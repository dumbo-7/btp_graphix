        "paragraph": " Suramin is a novel agent that has demonstrated preliminary evidence of antitumor activity in hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). A prospective randomized clinical trial was designed to evaluate pain and opioid analgesic intake as surrogates for antitumor response in HRPC patients with significant, opioid analgesic-dependent pain. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized patients to receive a 78-day, outpatient regimen of either suramin plus hydrocortisone (HC, 40 mg/d) or placebo plus HC. Treatment assignment was unblinded when either disease progression or dose-limiting toxicity occurred; placebo patients were allowed to cross-over to open-label suramin plus HC. In addition to pain and opioid analgesic intake, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, time to disease progression, quality of life, performance status, and survival were compared. Overall mean reductions in combined pain and opioid analgesic intake were greater for suramin plus HC (rank sum P =.0001). Pain response was achieved in a higher proportion of patients receiving suramin than placebo (43% v 28%; P =.001), and duration of response was longer for suramin responders (median, 240 v 69 days; P =.0027). Time to disease progression was longer (relative risk = 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 1.9) and the proportion of patients with a greater than 50% decline in PSA was higher (33% v 16%; P =.01) in patients who received suramin. Neither quality of life nor performance status was decreased by suramin treatment, and overall survival was similar. Most adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity and were easily managed medically. Outpatient treatment with suramin plus HC is well tolerated and provides moderate palliative benefit and delay in disease progression for patients with symptomatic HRPC. ",

Secondary end points included assessment of response (docetaxel arm only), toxicity, and quality of life. Patients with performance statuses of 0 to 2 and stage IIIB/IV non-small-cell lung cancer with either measurable or evaluable lesions were eligible for entry onto the study if they had undergone one or more platinum-based chemotherapy regimens and if they had adequate hematology and biochemistry parameters. They were excluded if they had symptomatic brain metastases or if they had previously been treated with paclitaxel. Patients were stratified by performance status and best response to cisplatin chemotherapy and were then randomized to treatment with docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) (49 patients) or 75 mg/m(2) (55 patients) or best supportive care. Patients in both arms were assessed every 3 weeks. One hundred four patients (103 of whom were eligible for entry onto the study) were well balanced for prognostic factors. Of 84 patients with measurable lesions, six (7. 1%) achieved partial responses (three patients at each dose level). Time to progression was longer for docetaxel patients than for best supportive care patients (10.6 v 6.7 weeks, respectively; P <.001), as was median survival (7.0 v 4.6 months; log-rank test, P =.047).

Prompt diagnosis and effective treatment is, therefore, essential. Several small studies have established the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in this setting, and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) would appear to be an alternative therapeutic option because of their established efficacy and better tolerability profile. This was a multicenter. double-blind, parallel-group study in which 179 women with breast cancer were randomized to treatment with either the SSRI paroxetine (20-40 mg/day), or the TCA, amitriptyline (75-150 mg/day). After 8-weeks treatment, depressive symptomatology had improved markedly and to a similar extent in both groups on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Clinical global impression (CGI) Global improvement and Patient global evaluation scales indicated that patients were minimally to much improved at study endpoint: a change from moderately/mildly ill to borderline ill on the CGI severity of Illness scale. A steady improvement in quality of life was also observed in both groups. There were no clinically significant differences between the groups. In total, 47 (53.4%) patients in the paroxetine group and 53 (59.6%) patients in the amitriptyline group had adverse experiences, the most common of which were the well-recognized side-effects of the antidepressant medications or chemotherapy. Anticholinergic effects were almost twice as frequent in the amitriptyline group (19.1%) compared with paroxetine (11.4%). This study has demonstrated that paroxetine is a suitable alternative to amitriptyline for the treatment of depression in patients with breast cancer. ",

In the present article, the effects of ATP on body composition, energy intake, and energy expenditure as secondary outcome measures in the same patients are reported. Patients with NSCLC, stage IIIB or IV, were randomized to receive either 10 intravenous, 30-hour ATP infusions every 2 to 4 weeks or no ATP. Fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), and arm muscle area were assessed at 4-week intervals for 28 weeks. Food intake, body cell mass (BCM), and resting energy expenditure (REE) were assessed at 8-week intervals for 16 weeks. Between-group differences were tested for statistical significance by repeated-measures analysis of covariance. Fifty-eight patients were randomized (28 ATP, 30 control). No change in body composition over the 28-week follow-up period was found in the ATP group, whereas, per 4 weeks, the control group lost 0.6 kg of FM (P =.004), 0.5 kg of FFM (P =.02), 1.8% of arm muscle area (P =.02), and 0.6% of BCM/kg body weight (P =.054) and decreased 568 KJ/d in energy intake (P =.0001). Appetite also remained stable in the ATP group but decreased significantly in the control group (P =.0004). No significant differences in REE between the ATP and control groups were observed. The inhibition of weight loss by ATP infusions in patients with advanced NSCLC is attributed to counteracting the loss of both metabolically active and inactive tissues. These effects are partly ascribed to maintenance of energy intake. ",

The study design was a phase II non-randomized trial in hospitalized patients setting. The treatment plan consisted of 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy with cisplatin, fluorouracil (5-FU), l-leucovorin and interferon alpha2b (PFL-IFN) followed by 7 cycles of 5-FU, hydroxyurea and concomitant radiation for 5 days (FHX) for a total radiation dose of 70 Gy. 13 Cis-retinoic acid was added to treatment regimen for chemoprevention and a systematic prophylaxis of mucositis was administered to all patients during FHX. Conservative surgical resection was reserved to patients with no optimal response (PR > or =70%), whereas radical surgery was performed as salvage treatment. Twenty-six patients were treated at one institution: more than 90% had stage IV disease and only 19.2% had laryngeal cancer. Eighty-one percent of patients had performance status 0 and 23.1% of patients had >5% weight loss at the start of treatment. Nineteen patients were analyzed for response to PFL-IFN: 3/19 (15.8%) patients achieved a CR and 7/19 (36.8%) achieved a PR for an ORR of 52.6%. FHX was administered on protocol to 12 patients: 6 patients (50%) had CR, 1 patient (8.3%) had PR for an ORR of 58.3%, 2 patients (16.7%) had SD and 3 patients (25%) had PD. At the completion of FHX, no patient underwent local therapy according to treatment plan. At a median follow-up time of 13.5 months (range 1-28+) at June 2001, among 26 patients enrolled 12 (46.1%) were still alive and 9 (75%) of them were progression-free. The median duration of response was 9 months (range 0-25+), the median progression-free survival was 10.5 months (range 0-28+), the median overall survival time was 9 months (range 1-22). The toxicity was significant and consisted mainly of mucositis and, to a lesser extent, neutropenia/thrombocytopenia. In the present study, the low serum levels of leptin and the high serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines in advanced stage cancer patients were confirmed. In conclusion, this sequential induction chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy program has been found moderately active and significantly toxic; moreover, the long overall treatment duration must be taken into consideration. For these reasons, this regimen could not be recommended for a phase III randomized study. ",

The safety and efficacy of LAC for colon cancer are unknown, and the nature and magnitude of any quality-of-life (QOL) benefit resulting from LAC for colon cancer is also unknown. To compare short-term QOL outcomes after LAC vs open colectomy for colon cancer. Multicenter, randomized controlled trial (Clinical Outcomes of Surgical Therapy [COST]). Between September 1994 and February 1999, 37 of 48 centers provided data for the QOL component of the trial for 449 consecutive patients with clinically resectable colon cancer. Scores on the Symptoms Distress Scale (SDS), Quality of Life Index, and a single-item global rating scale at 2 days, 2 weeks, and 2 months postoperative; duration of postoperative in-hospital analgesic use; and length of stay. Of 449 patients, 428 provided QOL data. In an intention-to-treat analysis comparing SDS pain intensity, SDS summary, QOL Index summary, and global rating scale scores at each time point, the only statistically significant difference observed between groups was the global rating scale score for 2 weeks postsurgery. The mean (median) global rating scale scores for 2 weeks postsurgery were 76.9 (80) for LAC vs 74.4 (75) for open colectomy (P =.009). While in the hospital, patients assigned to LAC required fewer days of both parenteral analgesics compared with patients assigned to open colectomy (mean [median], 3.2 [3] vs 4.0 [4] days; P<.001) and oral analgesics (mean [median], 1.9 [1] vs 2.2 [2] days; P =.03). Only minimal short-term QOL benefits were found with LAC for colon cancer compared with standard open colectomy. Until ongoing trials establish that LAC is as effective as open colectomy in preventing recurrence and death from colon cancer, this procedure should not be offered to patients with colon cancer. ",

One hundred fourteen women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive first-line treatment with trastuzumab 4 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 2 mg/kg weekly, or a higher 8 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 4 mg/kg weekly. The objective response rate was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.2% to 34.4%), with seven complete and 23 partial responses. Response rates in 111 assessable patients with 3+ and 2+ HER2 overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) were 35% (95% CI, 24.4% to 44.7%) and none (95% CI, 0% to 15.5%), respectively. The clinical benefit rates in assessable patients with 3+ and 2+ HER2 overexpression were 48% and 7%, respectively. The response rates in 108 assessable patients with and without HER2 gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis were 34% (95% CI, 23.9% to 45.7%) and 7% (95% CI, 0.8% to 22.8%), respectively. Seventeen (57%) of 30 patients with an objective response and 22 (51%) of 43 patients with clinical benefit had not experienced disease progression at follow-up at 12 months or later. The most common treatment-related adverse events were chills (25% of patients), asthenia (23%), fever (22%), pain (18%), and nausea (14%). Cardiac dysfunction occurred in two patients (2%); both had histories of cardiac disease and did not require additional intervention after discontinuation of trastuzumab. There was no clear evidence of a dose-response relationship for response, survival, or adverse events. Single-agent trastuzumab is active and well tolerated as first-line treatment of women with metastatic breast cancer with HER2 3+ overexpression by IHC or gene amplification by FISH. ",

We performed a retrospective analysis of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 5592, a phase III randomized trial of platinum-based chemotherapy regimens for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and compared outcomes in enrollees 70 years of age and older with those in younger patients. ECOG carried out a randomized phase III trial of cisplatin plus either etoposide or paclitaxel in chemotherapy-na\u00efve NSCLC patients with stages III(B) or IV disease. Toxic effects, response rates, and survival rates were compared between age groups. All P values were two-sided. A total of 574 patients enrolled from August 1993 through December 1994 were evaluable. Eighty-six (15%) were 70 years old or older. Older patients had a higher incidence of cardiovascular (P =.009) and respiratory (P =.04) comorbidities and nonanalgesic medication use (P =.02). Leukopenia (P<.001) and neuropsychiatric toxicity (P =.002) were more common in elderly men than in younger men. Elderly women lost more weight than younger women (P =.006). Other toxic effects were similar in older and younger patients. The proportions with clinical partial or complete response (21.5% versus 23.3%; Fisher's exact test, P =.66), median time to progression (4.37 versus 4.30 months; log-rank test, P =.29), and survival distribution (log-rank test, P =.29; median survival, 9.05 versus 8.53 months; 1-year survival, 38% versus 29%; and 2-year survival, 14% versus 12%) were similar in patients younger than 70 years and 70 years old or older. Baseline quality-of-life and treatment-outcome indices were similar. Equivalent declines over time in functional well-being occurred in both groups. Response rate, toxicity, and survival in fit, elderly NSCLC patients receiving platinum-based treatment appear to be similar to those in younger patients, although patients 70 years old or older have more comorbidities and can expect more leukopenia and neuropsychiatric toxicity. Advanced age alone should not preclude appropriate NSCLC treatment. ",

This trial was designed to measure any increased patient benefit by adding a single administration of SIR-Spheres to a regimen of regional hepatic artery chemotherapy (HAC) administered as a 12 day infusion of floxuridine and repeated at monthly intervals, vs. the same chemotherapy alone. A phase III randomised clinical trial entering 74 patients was undertaken on patients with bi-lobar non-resectable liver metastases from primary adenocarcinoma of the large bowel. Patient benefit criteria assessed in the trial were tumor response, time to disease progression in the liver, overall survival, quality of life, and treatment related toxicity. Tumor response was measured by serial changes in both cross-sectional tumor areas and total tumor volumes, provided any response lasted not less than three months as well as changes in serum carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA). The partial and complete response rate (PR + CR) was significantly greater for patients receiving SIR-Spheres when measured by tumor areas (44%) vs. 17.6%, P = 0.01) tumor volumes (50% vs. 24%, P = 0.03) and CEA (72% vs. 47%, P = 0.004). The median time to disease progression in the liver was significantly longer for patients receiving SIR-Spheres in comparison to patients receiving HAC alone when measured by either tumor areas (9.7 vs. 15.9 months, P = 0.001), tumor volumes (7.6 vs. 12.0 months, P = 0.04) or CEA (5.7 vs. 6.7 months, P = 0.06). The one, two, three and five-year survival for patients receiving SIR-Spheres was 72%, 39%, 17% and 3.5%, compared to 68%, 29%, 6.5% and 0% for HAC alone. Cox regression analysis suggests an improvement in survival for patients treated with SIR-Spheres who survive more than 15 months (P = 0.06). There was no increase in grade 3-4 treatment related toxicity and no loss of quality of life for patients receiving SIR-Spheres in comparison to patients receiving HAC alone. The combination of a single injection of SIR-Spheres plus HAC is substantially more effective in increasing tumor responses and progression free survival than the same regimen of HAC alone. ",

Treatment with high-dose IL-2 can cause severe toxicity and is normally administered in an inpatient setting. We conducted a multicenter prospective randomized clinical trial in outpatients with metastatic melanoma to compare CT with biochemotherapy (bioCT) using immunomodulant doses of IL-2 and IFN alpha-2b. One hundred seventy-six eligible patients with advanced melanoma were randomized to receive CT (cisplatin and dacarbazine with or without carmustine every 21 days) or bioCT comprising the same CT regimen followed by low-dose subcutaneous IL-2 for 8 days and IFN alpha-2b three times a week, both for six cycles. At a median follow-up of 18 (CT) and 16 (bioCT) months, median OS was 9.5 versus 11.0 months (P =.51), respectively. In the 89 CT-arm patients, 18 ORs (20.2%) (three complete responders [CRs] and 15 partial responders [PRs]) were observed according to World Health Organization criteria. In the 87 bioCT-arm patients, 22 ORs (25.3%) (three CRs and 19 PRs) (P =.70) were recorded. Treatment-related toxicity was fairly similar in both arms. The addition of low-dose immunotherapy did not produce a statistically significant advantage in OS, time to progression, or OR. However, the 11-month median OS in the bioCT arm does not differ greatly from the best results with high-dose IL-2-containing regimens reported in the literature. Furthermore, our treatment schedule was carried out on outpatients and had an acceptable level of toxicity. ",

In the original study, patients (n = 316) with hemoglobin (Hb) levels < or =12.1 g/dl were randomized 2:1 to receive either epoetin alfa at a dose of 10,000 U thrice weekly s.c. or best supportive care (BSC) to compare the effects on transfusion use, hematologic response, and QOL (measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia [FACT-An]and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale [CLAS]). The QOL data from this previously reported trial were reanalyzed here relative to population norms. Mean baseline QOL scores were similar between groups. At study completion, mean CLAS, FACT-An, FACT-An Anemia subscale, and FACT-An Fatigue subscale scores were significantly higher for patients given epoetin alfa than for those treated with BSC. Compared with population norms, both groups had impaired QOL at baseline. Differences in mean QOL change scores from baseline to study end for epoetin alfa versus BSC were 3.17 points for the FACT-General Total, 9.90 for the FACT-An Fatigue subscale, and 7.30 for the FACT-An Anemia subscale. This was equivalent to corrections in QOL deficits attributable to epoetin alfa of 97.3%, 40.7%, and 38.0% for the FACT-General Total, FACT-An Fatigue, and FACT-An Anemia subscale scores, respectively, versus BSC.

Patients with Hb levels < or =12.1 g/dl were randomized 2:1 to receive EPO, 10,000 U three times weekly s.c. or best supportive care (BSC) until 4 weeks after their last chemotherapy cycle. For this analysis, patients were stratified by baseline Hb level (< or =9.7 g/dl, >9.7 g/dl to < or =10.5 g/dl, >10.5 g/dl to < or =11.3 g/dl, and >11.3 g/dl to < or =12.1 g/dl), and study results were reanalyzed. Significantly fewer EPO patients than BSC patients with initial Hb levels >9.7 g/dl to < or =12.1 g/dl required transfusions. EPO maintained Hb levels throughout the study for patients with Hb levels >11.3 g/dl to < or =12.1 g/dl, compared with a decrease with BSC.

In patients with cancer receiving platinum-based chemotherapy and with baseline Hb levels >10.5 g/dl, early intervention with EPO reduces transfusions, maintains Hb level, and maintains or improves QOL.

Therefore, we evaluated quality of life in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) on TSH-suppressive thyroxine therapy as a model for subclinical hyperthyroidism and we investigated whether restoration to euthyroidism affects quality of life. We performed a prospective, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 6 months' duration with two parallel groups. Twenty-four subjects with a history of differentiated thyroid carcinoma with > 10 years TSH-suppressive therapy with L-thyroxine completed the study. L-thyroxine dose was replaced by study medication containing L-thyroxine or L-thyroxine plus placebo. Medication was titrated to establish continuation of TSH suppression (low-TSH group) and euthyroidism (euthyroid group). Both groups consisted of 12 patients. We evaluated quality of life using five validated questionnaires. At baseline, the somatic disorder questionnaire (SDQ) indicated more somatic dysfunction in patients as compared with reference values, whereas the depression score (HADS) revealed a better score than the reference group. All other quality of life parameters were normal. At baseline, no significant differences between the low-TSH and the euthyroidism groups were observed. After 6 months, none of the quality of life parameters in the low-TSH group was different from baseline values. In the euthyroid group, motivation was significantly improved (Multidimensional Fatigue Index-20, P = 0.003), although this parameter did not differ from the reference group at baseline. A probable worsening in role limitations as a result of physical problems (Short Form-36; P = 0.050) was observed. No improvement in the SDQ score was observed. In summary, quality of life in patients with DTC and long-term subclinical hyperthyroidism in general is preserved. Restoration of euthyroidism in general does not affect quality of life. ",

However, a prospective evaluation of clinical benefit in AGGEC patients has never before been reported in a phase III setting. In a multinational trial (V325), 445 patients were randomly assigned and treated with either docetaxel plus cisplatin and fluorouracil (DCF) or cisplatin and fluorouracil (CF). Clinical benefit was prospectively evaluated in this trial as a secondary end point. The primary measure for clinical benefit analysis was time to definitive worsening by one or more categories of Karnofsky performance status (KPS). Secondary clinical benefit end points included time to 5% definitive weight loss, time to definitive worsening of appetite by one grade, pain-free survival (defined as time to first appearance of pain), and time to first cancer pain-related opioid intake. Clinical benefit assessments were recorded at each clinic visit. Clinical benefit assessments were performed in more than 75% of patients throughout V325. DCF significantly prolonged time to definitive worsening of KPS compared with CF (median, 6.1 v 4.8 months; hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.76; log-rank P = .009). Although time to definitive weight loss and time to definitive worsening of appetite favored DCF, the results were not statistically significant. Pain-free survival and time to first cancer pain-related opioid intake were comparable. To our knowledge, V325 is the first phase III trial to report clinical benefit in AGGEC patients. Clinical benefit was assessed beyond protocol-specific chemotherapy. The addition of D to CF not only significantly improved clinical benefit but also improved quality of life, time to progression, and overall survival compared with CF. ",

The ability of somatostatin analogs to control the growth of well-differentiated metastatic NETs is a matter of debate. We performed a placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase IIIB study in patients with well-differentiated metastatic midgut NETs. The hypothesis was that octreotide LAR prolongs time to tumor progression and survival. Treatment-naive patients were randomly assigned to either placebo or octreotide LAR 30 mg intramuscularly in monthly intervals until tumor progression or death. The primary efficacy end point was time to tumor progression. Secondary end points were survival time and tumor response. This report is based on 67 tumor progressions and 16 observed deaths in 85 patients at the time of the planned interim analysis. Median time to tumor progression in the octreotide LAR and placebo groups was 14.3 and 6 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.59; P = .000072). After 6 months of treatment, stable disease was observed in 66.7% of patients in the octreotide LAR group and 37.2% of patients in the placebo group. Functionally active and inactive tumors responded similarly. The most favorable effect was observed in patients with low hepatic tumor load and resected primary tumor. Seven and nine deaths were observed in the octreotide LAR and placebo groups, respectively. The HR for overall survival was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.30 to 2.18).

Thereafter Z-360/placebo was given twice daily concurrently with standard dose of gemcitabine. Pharmacokinetics for both drugs was measured alone and in combination. Toxicity, response and quality of life were also recorded. Thirty-three patients with a median age of 62 years were randomised of which six had locally advanced disease and 26 had metastatic disease. Analysis of the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), the maximum observed concentration (Cmax(obs)) and the time of the maximum observed concentration (Tmax(obs)) for Z-360, gemcitabine and 2,2-difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU), could not exclude an effect on the systemic exposure to Z-360, gemcitabine and dFdU when co-administration of Z-360 and gemcitabine was compared with single agent administration. The most commonly reported adverse events were nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting and fatigue. At the end of the study, 62.5%, 25% and 60% had stable disease in the 120 mg, 240 mg and placebo group, respectively. A higher proportion of patients in Z-360 groups reported improvement in pain.

The authors' previous study demonstrated objectively improved sensation in a group of innervated transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap breast reconstruction patients relative to noninnervated flaps. This study compared patient-rated outcomes of free TRAM breast reconstruction in innervated versus noninnervated flaps. Twenty-seven women were randomized prospectively to undergo either innervated or noninnervated free TRAM flap breast reconstruction. For innervated flaps, the T10 intercostal nerve was harvested with the TRAM flap and neurotized to the T4 sensory nerve at the recipient site. Three validated outcome tools were administered after surgery: the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, the Body Image after Breast Cancer Questionnaire, and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast. Results were correlated with previously reported objective sensibility outcomes. Eighteen of 27 women returned their questionnaires a mean 48 months after free TRAM flap reconstruction. Demographic analysis revealed no significant differences in patient age, height, smoking, radiation therapy, and nipple-areola complex reconstruction between randomized patient groups. There was a statistically significant improvement in all three measures in patients who were randomized to receive innervated free TRAM flaps compared with those receiving noninnervated flaps. This study demonstrates that innervation of free TRAM flaps used for breast reconstruction not only improves sensibility but also has a positive effect on patient-rated quality of life. ",

Prospective and retrospective outcomes study. Tertiary care institution. Participants in the longitudinal Outcomes Assessment Project whose head and neck cancer was treated with CRT between February 1, 2000, and March 1, 2007 (n = 104). Patients prospectively provided functional and health-related quality of life information, including data from the 1-year and most current follow-up visits. Medical records were reviewed to determine toxicity and survival rates. Well-defined acute and late toxicities; functional outcomes (diet, dentition, tracheostomies); head and neck cancer-specific, general health, and depression outcomes; and survival rates. Most patients had oropharyngeal or laryngeal tumors (87.5%) and advanced-stage disease (75.0%). Approximately one-half had hematologic toxicities and toxicity-related treatment delays. Approximately one-quarter had neurotoxicities and/or ototoxicites, moist desquamation, pneumonia, nausea and vomiting requiring hospitalization or intravenous fluids, dehydration or malnutrition requiring hospitalization, and mild or moderate fever. Although patients receiving the current intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) protocol using the Pinnacle(3) planning system had more toxicity-related treatment delays, they had fewer toxicities and better functional and health-related quality of life outcomes compared with those receiving conventional lateral opposing-field radiation or the initial IMRT protocol using the Best nomos PEACOCK planning system. Patients receiving CRT experience a substantial number of treatment-related adverse events, primarily affecting oropharyngeal and laryngeal function, with improvement noted for the current IMRT protocol. Improving dental prosthetic rehabilitation and including evaluations with speech and swallowing pathologists before and during treatment may enhance patient outcomes. ",

To determine the benefit of starting pelvic floor muscle exercise (PFME) 30d before RP and of continuing PFME postoperatively for early recovery of continence. A randomised, prospective study was designed. Men with localised prostate cancer (PCa) who underwent an open radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) at our department of urology were included. Patients were randomised to start PFME preoperatively and continue postoperatively (active group: A) or to start PFME postoperatively alone (control group: B). The primary outcome measure was self-reported continence after surgery. Secondary outcome measures were assessed by degree of UI based on a 24-h pad test and QoL instruments (International Continence Society [ICS] male short form [SF]). Of 143 men evaluated for the study, 118 were randomised either to start PFME preoperatively and continue postoperatively (group A; n=59) or to start postoperative PFME (group B; n=59). After 1 mo, 44.1% (26 of 59) of patients were continent in group A, while 20.3% (12 of 59) were continent in group B (p=0.018). At 3 mo, 59.3% (35 of 59) and 37.3% (22 of 59) patients were continent in group A and group B, respectively (p=0.028). The ICS male SF mean score showed better results in group A than in group B patients at both 1 mo (14.6 vs 18.3) and 3 mo (8.1 vs 12.2) after RP (p=0.002). In age-adjusted logistic regression analyses, patients who performed preoperative PFME had a 0.41-fold lower risk of being incontinent 1 mo after RP and a 0.38-fold lower risk of being incontinent 3 mo after RP (p\u22640.001). Preoperative PFME may improve early continence and QoL outcomes after RP. Further studies are needed to corroborate our results. ",

Based on previous trials, octreotide acetate is widely recommended for the control of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea. However, the effectiveness of octreotide in preventing or controlling radiation- and chemoradiation-induced diarrhea is not known. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was designed to determine the efficacy of long-acting octreotide acetate (LAO) in preventing the onset of acute diarrhea in patients undergoing chemoradiation therapy for rectal or anal cancer. Between 4 and 7 days before the start of radiation therapy, patients received a 30-mg dose of LAO (109 patients) or placebo (106 patients) via intramuscular injection. A second dose was given on day 22 (+/-3 days) of radiation treatment. A total of 215 patients were included in the final analysis. The primary endpoint was the incidence of grade 2-4 acute diarrhea; secondary endpoints included treatment compliance, medical resource utilization, patient-reported bowel function, and quality of life (QoL). Statistical tests were one- or two-sided, as specified. After a median follow-up time of 9.64 months, incidence rates of grades 2-4 acute diarrhea were similar in both groups (49% placebo vs 44% LAO; P = .21). No statistically significant treatment differences in chemotherapy or radiation delivery, medical resource utilization, patient-reported bowel function, or QoL were observed.

Median PFS was 2.3 months for each arm (HR, 1.004; 95% CI, 0.841 to 1.199). ORR, stable disease, median OS, were 4.4% versus 5.5%, 36.0% versus 39.6%, 6.7 versus 7.2 months (HR, 0.973; 95% CI, 0.805 to 1.176), respectively. No significant difference in patient benefit and QOL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung). No unexpected adverse events were observed. Grade higher than 0 (vinflunine v docetaxel) anemia (82.1% v 79.8%), neutropenia (49.3 v 39.02%), thrombocytopenia (30.6% v 14.3%), febrile neutropenia (3.3% v 4.7%), constipation (39.2% v 11.7%), fatigue (36.6% v 33.9%), injection site reaction (31.9% v 0.7%), nausea (26.7% v 23.7%), vomiting (23.8% v 14.2%), alopecia (19.8% v 35.4%), stomatis (19.4% v 12.4%), abdominal pain (20.1% v 3.6%), myalgia (14.7% v 6.6%), peripheral neuropathy (10.7% v 15.0%), arthralgia (7.0% v 7.7%), diarrhea (6.2% v 12.4%), edema (1.5% v 5.4%), and nail disorders (1.1% v 5;1%) were observed. This noninferiority phase III study showed similar efficacy end points for vinflunine and docetaxel. Despite higher rates of some adverse effects (anemia, abdominal pain, constipation, fatigue) the overall toxicity profile of vinflunine was manageable. Therefore, VFL may be another option in the second-line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC. ",

        "paragraph": " A significant proportion of patients develop urinary incontinence early after radical prostatectomy. Posterior reconstruction of supporting tissues has been found to reduce incontinence in open and conventional laparoscopic prostatectomy series. To investigate whether our version of a posterior musculofascial reconstruction will reduce early incontinence and have a beneficial effect on patients' quality of life (QoL). One hundred seven consecutive patients undergoing primary robot-assisted radical laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) performed by a single surgeon at one tertiary referral oncology institution were alternately assigned (not randomised) to intervention (n=53) or control groups (n=54). RALP with median fibrous raphe reconstruction (MFRR) followed by formation of the urethrovesical anastomosis (intervention group) versus standard anastomosis without posterior reconstruction (control group). Measurements included incontinence at baseline and 3-mo intervals; QoL as measured by a simple questionnaire, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life-Core 30 (QLQ-C30), and Prostate Cancer Module (PR25) questionnaires preoperatively and at 6 mo postprocedure; tumour characteristics; operative time; fascial preservation score; duration of catheterisation; and anastomotic leakage on cystogram. For intervention and control groups respectively, mean catheter duration was 11.74 d and 12.74 d (p=0.451); leakage on cystogram was present in six and eight cases (p=0.28); and incontinence (any involuntary urine loss) at 3 mo was 75% and 69% (p=0.391) and at 6 mo was 51% and 43% (p=0.686). Urinary retention occurred only in one case (control group). The percentage of cases returning to baseline in all QoL domains (except insomnia) was similar at 6 mo between the two groups. Short follow-up, lack of blinding, and probable small differences in our method of MFRR performed compared with other studies were identified as significant limitations. No significant difference in any of the analysed outcome measures was observed. Posterior reconstruction of the musculofascial complex does not appear to improve early urinary incontinence after RALP. ",

We evaluated 4 doses of 3-weekly docetaxel to identify a less toxic, clinically effective dose. Seventy-three patients with stage III (22%) (unsuitable for radical surgery/radiotherapy) and IV (78%) NSCLC were randomized to receive 4 doses of 3-weekly docetaxel, for 4 cycles: arm (A) 40 mg/m(2) (n=17), arm (B) 50 mg/m(2) (n=17), arm (C) 60 mg/m(2) (n=19), arm (D) 50 mg/m(2) escalated by 10 mg/m(2) to a maximum of 70 mg/m(2) (n=19). Primary endpoints: maximum tolerated dose, RR, duration of response, symptom improvement, toxicity and QoL. Secondary endpoint: overall survival (OS). Patients and disease characteristics were well balanced. Median age was 67 (range 45-81), there were 32 male and 41 female, histology subtype: squamous/adenocarcinoma/mixed/NOS=42%/49%/4%/5%. Seven patients did not receive any treatment because of deterioration in PS or death. 50% of patients in arm D, who received more than one cycle, received dose escalation. There was no statistical difference in the number of cycles administered (arms A, B and D: median 2 cycles and arm C: median 3 cycles) and no difference in RR: arm A=6%, arm B=6%, arm C=10%, and arm D=0%. There was no statistically significant difference in grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia between the four arms. No difference was observed in hospitalization rate, blood transfusions, antibiotics administration and non-haematological toxicity. QoL: no difference in total scores between baseline and cycles 1-4. There was a significant decrease in pain scores from baseline to post cycles 2 and 3 (p=0.025 and p=0.002, respectively). There was no difference in OS (p=0.992). Median survival and 6-month survival were 61, 86, 88 and 97 days and 29%, 33%, 21% and 26% for arms A, B, C, and D, respectively. Clinical efficacy of docetaxel was observed at all dose levels. Higher dose levels were not associated with increased toxicities, use of IV antibiotics or hospitalization rates. However, the median survival observed is shorter than historical data and do not support further evaluation of these doses of single agent docetaxel in this population. ",

A randomised controlled clinical trial, using a method of minimisation balanced by centre, grade of cancer, age, lymphovascular invasion and preoperative endocrine therapy was performed. Breast cancer clinics in cancer centres in the UK. Patients aged \u2265\u200965 years were eligible provided that their breast cancers were considered to be at low risk of local recurrence, they were suitable for breast conservation surgery, they were receiving endocrine therapy and they were willing and able to give informed consent. The standard treatment of post-operative whole breast irradiation or the omission of RT. Quality of life was the primary outcome measure, together with anxiety and depression and cost-effectiveness. Secondary outcome measures were recurrence rates and survival, and treatment-related morbidity. The principal method of data collection was by questionnaire, completed at home with a research nurse on four occasions over 15 months, then by postal questionnaire at 3 and 5 years after surgery. The hypothesised improvement in overall quality of life with the omission of RT was not seen in the summary domains of the European Organisation for Research in the Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) scales. Some differences were apparent within subscales of the EORTC questionnaires, and insights into the impact of treatment were also provided by the qualitative data obtained by open-ended questions added by the trial team. Differences were most apparent shortly after the time of completion of RT. RT was then associated with increased breast symptoms and with greater (self-reported) fatigue, but with lower levels of insomnia and endocrine side effects. These statistically significant differences in breast symptoms persisted for up to 5 years after RT [mean difference, RT was 5.27 units greater than no RT, 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.46 to 9.07], with similar, though non-significant, trends in insomnia. No significant difference was found in the overall quality of life measure, with the no RT group having 0.36 units greater quality of life than the RT group (95% CI -5.09 to 5.81). Breast RT is tolerated well by most older breast cancer patients without impairing their overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Although HRQoL should always be taken into account when determining treatment, our results show that the addition of RT does not impair overall quality of life. Further economic modelling on the longer-term costs and consequences of omitting RT is required. ",

Fifty non-progressive patients with advanced NSCLC who responded to first-line therapy were randomized into the test group (25 cases, treated with CM comprehensive regimen: intravenous dripping of Chinese herbal preparation, oral administration of Chinese herbal decoction, and point application) and the control group [25 cases, treated with one of three single-agent maintenance chemotherapy regimens: pemetrexed (500 mg/m2, day 1), docetaxel (75 mg/m2, day 1), and gemcitabine (1000 mg/mi, day 1 and day 8) in the ratio of 1:1]. Each cycle consisted of 21 days. Cycles were repeated until the disease progressed, or intolerable toxic or adverse reaction occurred, or patients refused to continue the treatment.

Seventy consecutive breast cancer patients were randomized to either a one-stage reconstruction with a round permanent expander implant (Becker 25; n=35) or a two-stage reconstruction with a crescent-shaped expander (LV 133; n=35), later replaced by a form-stable anatomical implant. Thirty patients had to be excluded and 40 patients, 20 in each group, were evaluated. The median follow-up for both groups was 3.5 years (range, 1.5 to 5 years). Plastic cups, plastic casts, and two -and three-dimensional scanning techniques were used for objective assessment of breast volume and shape. The aesthetic outcome was evaluated by a panel of experts and lay people, and by the patients. Quality of life was evaluated with a validated questionnaire (36-Item Short Form Health Survey). Of the patients in the one-stage group, 70 percent had revision surgery, mostly because of upper pole fullness and poor ptosis. These findings agreed with the data from the two-dimensional scanning and from the expert panel and the patients' subjective judgment. Quality of life was similar in the two groups. The permanent expander method failed significantly as a one-stage procedure. The crescent two-stage method gave the most acceptable results both objectively and subjectively.",

To compare intermittent androgen deprivation (IAD) and continuous androgen deprivation (CAD) with regard to health-related quality of life (QoL). A total of 852 men with advanced prostate cancer (PCa) were enrolled to receive goserelin acetate 3.6 mg every 28 d for 24 wk. A total of 554 patients whose prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decreased to <10 ng/ml or by \u226550% (<20 ng/ml at baseline) were randomised to IAD or CAD. In the IAD arm, ADT was resumed for at least 24 wk whenever PSA increased >20 ng/ml or above baseline. QoL was monitored with a validated Cleary 30-item questionnaire and analysed by the Mann-Whitney U test, 0.5 standard deviation rule, and repeated measures analysis of variance. AEs and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were analysed by the chi-square test. Median follow-up was 65 mo. Significant differences in QoL emerged in activity limitation, physical capacity, and sexual functioning, favouring IAD. No significant differences emerged in the prevalence of AEs: 87 patients in the IAD arm (31.8%) and 95 in the CAD arm (33.9%) had cardiovascular (CV) AEs (p=0.59), with 25 (9.1%) and 29 (10.4%) withdrawn (p=0.62), and 21 (7.7%) and 24 (8.6%) dying because of a CV event (p=0.70), respectively; bone fractures occurred in 19 (6.9%) and 15 (5.4%) patients (p=0.44), respectively.

Whether these patients need to remain on ADT has not been well studied. We conducted a multicenter randomized trial to compare an intermittent versus continuous approach to ADT in CRPCa patients. Overall survival, health-related quality of life (QOL), and cost were the main endpoints. CRPCa patients were randomized 2:1 to intermittent or continuous luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists (LHRHa). Patients were followed with clinical assessments, laboratory investigations, and QOL questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 or PROSQOLI) every 2 months. If the serum testosterone rose above castrate levels (1.75 nmol/L), LHRHa were reinitiated. The study was designed to close if >50% of patients needed to restart ADT in the intermittent arm. Thirty-one patients were followed with a median follow-up of 26.8 months-18 in the intermittent arm and 13 in the continuous. Twelve of 18 patients on the intermittent arm were reinitiated on LHRHa at a median time of 17.9 months. There was no difference in overall or cancer-specific survival between the 2 arms. There was no statistically significant difference in QOL between the 2 arms at 0 and 12 months. The total mean costs at 24 months were significantly lower in the intermittent arm ($3135 vs. $8253 Canadian dollars, P=0.0167) compared with the continuous. The main limitation of this study is the small sample size. We have observed that intermittent ADT in patients with CRPCa, using a testosterone of >1.75 ngmol/L as a trigger to reinitiate LHRHa, results in a substantial cost savings with no negative impact on oncologic and QOL outcomes.

We did a randomised trial to assess the optimum palliative treatment in patients aged 60 years and older with glioblastoma. Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma were recruited from Austria, Denmark, France, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey. They were assigned by a computer-generated randomisation schedule, stratified by centre, to receive temozolomide (200 mg/m(2) on days 1-5 of every 28 days for up to six cycles), hypofractionated radiotherapy (34\u00b70 Gy administered in 3\u00b74 Gy fractions over 2 weeks), or standard radiotherapy (60\u00b70 Gy administered in 2\u00b70 Gy fractions over 6 weeks). Patients and study staff were aware of treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN81470623. 342 patients were enrolled, of whom 291 were randomised across three treatment groups (temozolomide n=93, hypofractionated radiotherapy n=98, standard radiotherapy n=100) and 51 of whom were randomised across only two groups (temozolomide n=26, hypofractionated radiotherapy n=25). In the three-group randomisation, in comparison with standard radiotherapy, median overall survival was significantly longer with temozolomide (8\u00b73 months [95% CI 7\u00b71-9\u00b75; n=93] vs 6\u00b70 months [95% CI 5\u00b71-6\u00b78; n=100], hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b770; 95% CI 0\u00b752-0\u00b793, p=0\u00b701), but not with hypofractionated radiotherapy (7\u00b75 months [6\u00b75-8\u00b76; n=98], HR 0\u00b785 [0\u00b764-1\u00b712], p=0\u00b724). For all patients who received temozolomide or hypofractionated radiotherapy (n=242) overall survival was similar (8\u00b74 months [7\u00b73-9\u00b74; n=119] vs 7\u00b74 months [6\u00b74-8\u00b74; n=123]; HR 0\u00b782, 95% CI 0\u00b763-1\u00b706; p=0\u00b712). For age older than 70 years, survival was better with temozolomide and with hypofractionated radiotherapy than with standard radiotherapy (HR for temozolomide vs standard radiotherapy 0\u00b735 [0\u00b721-0\u00b756], p<0\u00b70001; HR for hypofractionated vs standard radiotherapy 0\u00b759 [95% CI 0\u00b737-0\u00b793], p=0\u00b702). Patients treated with temozolomide who had tumour MGMT promoter methylation had significantly longer survival than those without MGMT promoter methylation (9\u00b77 months [95% CI 8\u00b70-11\u00b74] vs 6\u00b78 months [5\u00b79-7\u00b77]; HR 0\u00b756 [95% CI 0\u00b734-0\u00b793], p=0\u00b702), but no difference was noted between those with methylated and unmethylated MGMT promoter treated with radiotherapy (HR 0\u00b797 [95% CI 0\u00b769-1\u00b738]; p=0\u00b781). As expected, the most common grade 3-4 adverse events in the temozolomide group were neutropenia (n=12) and thrombocytopenia (n=18). Grade 3-5 infections in all randomisation groups were reported in 18 patients. Two patients had fatal infections (one in the temozolomide group and one in the standard radiotherapy group) and one in the temozolomide group with grade 2 thrombocytopenia died from complications after surgery for a gastrointestinal bleed. Standard radiotherapy was associated with poor outcomes, especially in patients older than 70 years. Both temozolomide and hypofractionated radiotherapy should be considered as standard treatment options in elderly patients with glioblastoma. MGMT promoter methylation status might be a useful predictive marker for benefit from temozolomide. ",

Patients received SAMITAL\u00ae or placebo four times daily for up to 50 days during scheduled chemo/radiotherapy. Severity of OM was monitored according to a modified WHO severity scale, and pain and quality-of-life assessments were based on the effect of symptoms of OM on relevant daily activities, according to a visual analogue scale. Mean scores for the severity of OM were significantly (p < 0.05 versus baseline) reduced from day 31 until the end of treatment in patients treated with SAMITAL\u00ae (n = 20). No significant improvement was observed in the placebo group (n = 10). Pain reduction was significant from day 4 till end of treatment with SAMITAL\u00ae and from days 7 to 21 in placebo patients. SAMITAL\u00ae also significantly improved quality of life, as shown by improvements in scores for relevant daily activities including eating, drinking and sleeping. All SAMITAL\u00ae patients completed the treatment period, but no placebo recipients completed treatment. No severe adverse events were observed with SAMITAL\u00ae, and systemic absorption of relevant active ingredients was undetectable. SAMITAL\u00ae significantly decreased the severity of chemo/radiotherapy-induced OM in patients with head and neck cancer, with no treatment-related adverse events. Pain relief lasted through the treatment period, and improvements in quality of life were reflected by the significant benefits of SAMITAL\u00ae on activities like drinking, eating and speaking. ",

A total of 208 men who presented for radical prostatectomy were randomized to complete bladder neck preservation with subsequent urethro-urethral anastomosis or to no preservation as controls. Patients with failed bladder neck preservation were not included in study. We documented objective continence by the 24-hour pad test, social continence by the number of pads per day and quality of life outcomes by the validated Incontinence Quality of Life questionnaire in a single blind setting. Cancer resection was assessed by surgical margin status. At 0, 3, 6 and 12 months mean urine loss in the control vs the bladder neck preservation group was 713.3 vs 237.0, 49.6 vs 15.6, 44.4 vs 5.5 and 25.4 vs 3.1 gm, respectively (each p <0.001). At 3, 6 and 12 months in the control vs the preservation group the social continence rate was 55.3% vs 84.2% (p <0.001), 74.8% vs 89.5% (p = 0.05) and 81.4% vs 94.7% (p = 0.027), and the quality of life score was 80.4 vs 90.3 (p <0.001), 85.4 vs 91.7 (p = 0.016) and 86.0 vs 93.8 (p = 0.001), respectively. We noted significantly less urine loss, higher objective and social continence rates, and higher quality of life scores after complete bladder neck preservation at all followup points. On multiple logistic regression analysis complete bladder neck preservation was an independent positive predictor of continence. No significant difference was found in surgical margin status between the control and bladder neck preservation groups (12.5% vs 14.7%, p = 0.65). In what is to our knowledge the first prospective, randomized, controlled, single blind trial complete bladder neck preservation during radical prostatectomy was associated with a significantly higher urinary continence rate and increased patient satisfaction without compromising resection margins.

We hypothesised that 2-weekly administration of docetaxel would be better tolerated than 3-weekly docetaxel in patients with castration-resistant advanced prostate cancer, and did a prospective, multicentre, randomised, phase 3 study to compare efficacy and safety. Eligible patients had advanced prostate cancer (metastasis, a prostate-specific-antigen test result of more than 10\u00b70 ng/mL, and WHO performance status score of 0-2), had received no chemotherapy (except with estramustine), had undergone surgical or chemical castration, and had been referred to a treatment centre in Finland, Ireland, or Sweden. Enrolment and treatment were done between March 1, 2004, and May 31, 2009. Randomisation was done centrally and stratified by centre and WHO performance status score of 0-1 vs 2. Patients were assigned 75 mg/m(2) docetaxel intravenously on day 1 of a 3-week cycle, or 50 mg/m(2) docetaxel intravenously on days 1 and 15 of a 4-week cycle. 10 mg oral prednisolone was administered daily to all patients. The primary endpoint was time to treatment failure (TTTF). We assessed data in the per-protocol population. 177 patients were randomly assigned to the 2-weekly docetaxel group and 184 to the 3-weekly group. 170 patients in the 2-weekly group and 176 in the 3-weekly group were included in the analysis. The 2-weekly administration was associated with significantly longer TTTF than was 3-weekly administration (5\u00b76 months, 95% CI 5\u00b70-6\u00b72 vs 4\u00b79 months, 4\u00b75-5\u00b74; hazard ratio 1\u00b73, 95% CI 1\u00b71-1\u00b76, p=0\u00b7014). Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred more frequently in the 3-weekly than in the 2-weekly administration group, including neutropenia (93 [53%] vs 61 [36%]), leucopenia (51 [29%] vs 22 [13%]), and febrile neutropenia (25 [14%] vs six [4%]). Neutropenic infections were reported more frequently in patients who received docetaxel every 3 weeks (43 [24%] vs 11 [6%], p=0\u00b7002).

        "paragraph": " In the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup International Collaboration on Ovarian Neoplasms 7 (ICON7) trial, bevacizumab improved progression-free survival in patients with ovarian cancer when used in combination with first-line chemotherapy and as a single-drug continuation treatment for 18 cycles. In a preliminary analysis of a high-risk subset of patients, there was also an improvement in overall survival. This study aims to describe the health-related quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes from ICON7. ICON7 is a randomised, multicentre, open-label phase 3 trial. Between Dec 18, 2006, and Feb 16, 2009, after a surgical procedure aiming to debulk the disease, women with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) high-risk stage I-IV epithelial ovarian cancer were randomly allocated (1:1) by computer program and block randomisation to receive either six cycles of standard chemotherapy (total 18 weeks) with carboplatin (area under the curve 5 or 6) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)) alone or with bevacizumab (7\u00b75 mg/kg) given intravenously with chemotherapy and continued as a single drug thereafter (total 54 weeks). The primary QoL endpoint was global QoL from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality-of-life questionnaire-core 30 at week 54, analysed by ANOVA and adjusted for baseline score. Analyses were by intention to treat. The ICON7 trial has completed recruitment and remains in follow-up. This study is registered, number ISRCTN91273375. 764 women were randomly assigned to the standard chemotherapy group and 764 to the bevacizumab group. At baseline, 684 (90%) of women in the standard chemotherapy group and 691 (90%) of those in the bevacizumab group had completed QoL questionnaires. At week 54, 502 (66%) women in the bevacizumab group and 388 (51%) women in the standard chemotherapy group provided QoL data. Overall, the mean global QoL score improved during chemotherapy by 7\u00b72 points (SD 24\u00b74) when analysed for all women with data at baseline and week 18. The mean global QoL score at 54 weeks was higher in the standard chemotherapy group than in the bevacizumab group (76\u00b71 [SD 18\u00b72] vs 69\u00b77 [19\u00b71] points; difference 6\u00b74 points, 95% CI 3\u00b77-9\u00b70, p<0\u00b70001). Bevacizumab continuation treatment seems to be associated with a small but clinically significant decrement in QoL compared with standard treatment for women with ovarian cancer. The trade-off between the prolongation of progression-free survival and the quality of that period of time needs to be considered in clinical practice when making treatment decisions. ",

        "paragraph": " Quality of life (QoL) after breast cancer is nowadays a major challenge. Complementary interventions are necessary because of frequent depression symptoms after treatment and also to favour return to activity. Besides, radio-chemotherapy has side-effects like weight gain and fatigue. Several strategies including group behavioural-educational interventions, physical training and/or dietary education, have been tested to answer these difficulties with moderate success in the long run. Two hundred and fifty-one non-metastatic patients were accrued after chemotherapy in a prospective randomised multicenter trial between 2008 and 2010, testing a 2-week intervention in SPA centres. Intervention comprised group physical training, dietary education and physiotherapy. Selected patients were in complete remission. QoL was evaluated with SF36 questionnaire, anxiety and depression with the hospital anxiety and depression (HAD) one. Anthropometric measures and QoL evaluations were obtained before randomisation and every 6 months during 3 years. Two hundred and twenty patients were evaluable at 1 year. Intervention increased SF36 score by 9.5 points (p=0.000006), 4.6 (p=0.032) and 6.2 (p=0.028) respectively at 6, 12 and 24 months. Effect size (ES) was 0.63 [0.37; 0.90], 0.29 [0.03; 0.55] and 0.41 [0.04; 0.78]. Anxiety score was shortly minored by intervention (6-month ES=-0.24 [-0.42; -0.05]) and depression score more durably: ES=-0.45 [-0.72; -0.18], -0.34 [-061; -0.08], and -0.26 [-0.63; 0.11] at 6, 12 and 24 months. This 2-week group intervention seemed to durably influence QoL of breast cancer patients treated by chemotherapy. Differences, smaller at 12 months than at six, suggest that a second but shorter intervention could help maintain the 6-month benefits. ",

The safety and efficacy of anticancer treatments may be influenced by ethnicity (Sekine et al. in Br J Cancer 99:1757-62, 2008). Safety and efficacy results from Asian versus non-Asian patients in BOLERO-2 are reported. Patients were randomized (2:1) to 10 mg/day EVE + EXE or placebo (PBO) + EXE. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival, response rate, clinical benefit rate, and safety. Of 143 Asian patients, 98 received EVE + EXE and 45 received PBO + EXE. Treatment with EVE + EXE significantly improved median PFS versus PBO + EXE among Asian patients by 38 % (HR = 0.62; 95 % CI, 0.41-0.94). Median PFS was also improved among non-Asian patients by 59 % (HR = 0.41; 95 % CI, 0.33-0.50). Median PFS duration among EVE-treated Asian patients was 8.48 versus 4.14 months for PBO + EXE, and 7.33 versus 2.83 months, respectively, in non-Asian patients. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events (stomatitis, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, hyperglycemia, and dyspnea) occurred at similar frequencies in Asian and non-Asian patients. Grade 1/2 interstitial lung disease occurred more frequently in Asian patients. Quality of life was similar between treatment arms in Asian patients. Adding EVE to EXE provided substantial clinical benefit in both Asian and non-Asian patients with similar safety profiles.

We compared the quality of life of patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer who received adjuvant intravesical gemcitabine or 1/3 dose bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin. Our multicenter, prospective, randomized, phase II study included 120 patients with intermediate risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. Of these patients 88 remained assessable at 1-year followup.

Overall 61 patients received 2,000 mg/50 cc gemcitabine weekly for 6 weeks (maintenance monthly for 1 year) while 59 received 1/3 dose bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin Connaught weekly for 6 weeks (maintenance 3 weekly instillations at 3, 6 and 12 months). Quality of life was measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 (European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 version 3.0) and QLQ-BLS24 (Quality of Life Superficial Bladder Cancer-Specific 24) questionnaires.

This randomized controlled trial examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a Tibetan Sound Meditation (TSM) program to improve cognitive function and quality of life in breast cancer patients. Forty-seven breast cancer patients (mean age 56.3\u2009years), who were staged I-III at diagnosis, 6-60\u2009months post-chemotherapy, and reported cognitive impairment at study entry were recruited. Participants were randomized to either two weekly TSM sessions for 6\u2009weeks or a wait list control group. Neuropsychological assessments were completed at baseline and 1\u2009month post-treatment. Self-report measures of cognitive function (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Cog), quality of life (SF-36), depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), sleep disturbance (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), fatigue (Brief Fatigue Inventory), and spirituality (FACT-Sp) were completed at baseline, the end of treatment, and 1\u2009month later. Relative to the control group, women in the TSM group performed better on the verbal memory test (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test trial 1) (p\u2009=\u20090.06) and the short-term memory and processing speed task (Digit Symbol) (p\u2009=\u20090.09) and reported improved cognitive function (p\u2009=\u20090.06), cognitive abilities (p\u2009=\u20090.08), mental health (p\u2009=\u20090.04), and spirituality (p\u2009=\u20090.05) at the end of treatment but not 1\u2009month later. This randomized controlled trial revealed that TSM program appears to be a feasible and acceptable intervention and may be associated with short-term improvements in objective and subjective cognitive function as well as mental health and spirituality in breast cancer patients.

While minimal invasive techniques have been applied increasingly, clear evidence of superiority for laparoscopic pouch procedures is not yet available. The aim of the LapConPouch Trial was to compare the effectiveness of laparoscopic (LAP) versus conventional (CON) ileoanal pouch procedure in patients undergoing elective restorative proctocolectomy. The trial was designed as a single-centre, pre-operatively randomized, controlled trial using a two-group parallel superiority design. Eligible for participation were patients scheduled for restorative proctocolectomy either for FAP or for UC. Patients and outcome assessors were blinded to group assignment. The primary endpoint was defined as the amount of blood loss. Statistical analyses were explorative since the trial had to be stopped prematurely. A total of 42 patients (21 LAP (50.0\u00a0%); 21 CON (50.0\u00a0%)) were randomized. The trial had to be stopped prematurely due to insufficient patient recruitment. There was no difference in the amount of blood loss between both groups: LAP 261.5\u2009\u00b1\u2009195.4\u00a0ml, CON 228.1\u2009\u00b1\u2009119.5\u00a0ml. Secondary endpoints differ in both groups. Laparoscopic surgery was superior regarding the length of skin incision; in contrast, the conventional approach was superior in duration of operation. There were no discrepancies in length of hospital stay, postoperative pain, bowel function, and quality of life between both approaches. The conversion rate from LAP to CON approach was 23.8 %. There was no difference with respect to blood loss between the LAP and the CON group. The LAP approach is feasible for restorative proctocolectomy, and IPAA seems at least as safe as CON surgery. The most obvious advantage of the minimal invasive technique is the improved cosmesis. ",

This study aimed to determine the effects of a telephone-delivered multiple health behavior change intervention (CanChange) on health and behavioral outcomes among colorectal cancer survivors. In this two-group randomized controlled trial, 410 colorectal cancer survivors were randomly assigned to the health coaching intervention (11 theory-based telephone-delivered health coaching sessions delivered over 6 months focusing on physical activity, weight management, dietary habits, alcohol, and smoking) or usual care. Assessment of primary (ie, physical activity [Godin Leisure Time Index], health-related quality of life [HRQoL; Short Form-36], and cancer-related fatigue [Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale]) and secondary outcomes (ie, body mass index [kg/m(2)], diet and alcohol intake [Food Frequency Questionnaire], and smoking) were conducted at baseline and 6 and 12 months. At 12 months, significant intervention effects were observed for moderate physical activity (28.5 minutes; P = .003), body mass index (-0.9 kg/m(2); P = .001), energy from total fat (-7.0%; P = .006), and energy from saturated fat (-2.8%; P = .016).

No significant group differences were found at 6 or 12 months for HRQoL, cancer-related fatigue, fruit, fiber, or alcohol intake, or smoking.

Although multiple international study trials exist for the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma, only very limited information is given on treatment, outcome, and QOL in PRMS. A total of 35 patients suffering from PRMS were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Local therapy with radiation and/or surgery was performed, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Functional long-term follow-up was evaluated by a gastrointestinal/QOL survey. Thirty-two patients were evaluated (exclusion n = 3). Eight patients had embryonal histology, and 24 patients had alveolar histology. The median age was 108 months (median follow-up: 5.8 years). The 5-year overall survival was 47% (95% confidence interval: 29-64). Sixteen IRS (Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study) III and IV patients had locoregional lymph node involvement at diagnosis. Seven patients were treated with chemotherapy/surgery alone [5-year event-free survival (EFS): 85.7%]. Eleven patients received only radiochemotherapy (5-year EFS: 27.3%). Combined radiochemotherapy/surgery was used in 12 patients (5-year EFS: 63.6%). Two patients were treated only with chemotherapy and they died. Patients with embryonal histology had a significantly better 5-year EFS (87.5%) than patients with alveolar histology (39.1%; P = 0.013). Some patients reported symptoms of fecal incontinence. The median Wexner fecal incontinence score was 9 (possible range: 0-20), and the median QOL score was 90.5 (applicable range: 0-144). The outcome of these patients remains unsatisfactory. Prognostic factors for a favorable outcome are tumor size of smaller than 5 cm, negative locoregional lymph nodes, age less than 10 years, low IRS group, and embryonal histology.

        "paragraph": " Menopausal hormone therapy continues in clinical use but questions remain regarding its risks and benefits for chronic disease prevention. To report a comprehensive, integrated overview of findings from the 2 Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone therapy trials with extended postintervention follow-up. A total of 27,347 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years were enrolled at 40 US centers. Women with an intact uterus received conjugated equine estrogens (CEE; 0.625 mg/d) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 2.5 mg/d) (n\u2009=\u20098506) or placebo (n\u2009=\u20098102). Women with prior hysterectomy received CEE alone (0.625 mg/d) (n\u2009=\u20095310) or placebo (n\u2009=\u20095429). The intervention lasted a median of 5.6 years in CEE plus MPA trial and 7.2 years in CEE alone trial with 13 years of cumulative follow-up until September 30, 2010. Primary efficacy and safety outcomes were coronary heart disease (CHD) and invasive breast cancer, respectively. A global index also included stroke, pulmonary embolism, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, hip fracture, and death. During the CEE plus MPA intervention phase, the numbers of CHD cases were 196 for CEE plus MPA vs 159 for placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 1.18; 95% CI, 0.95-1.45) and 206 vs 155, respectively, for invasive breast cancer (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.01-1.53). Other risks included increased stroke, pulmonary embolism, dementia (in women aged \u226565 years), gallbladder disease, and urinary incontinence; benefits included decreased hip fractures, diabetes, and vasomotor symptoms. Most risks and benefits dissipated postintervention, although some elevation in breast cancer risk persisted during cumulative follow-up (434 cases for CEE plus MPA vs 323 for placebo; HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.11-1.48]). The risks and benefits were more balanced during the CEE alone intervention with 204 CHD cases for CEE alone vs 222 cases for placebo (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.78-1.14) and 104 vs 135, respectively, for invasive breast cancer (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.02); cumulatively, there were 168 vs 216, respectively, cases of breast cancer diagnosed (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97). Results for other outcomes were similar to CEE plus MPA. Neither regimen affected all-cause mortality. For CEE alone, younger women (aged 50-59 years) had more favorable results for all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and the global index (nominal P\u2009<\u2009.05 for trend by age). Absolute risks of adverse events (measured by the global index) per 10,000 women annually taking CEE plus MPA ranged from 12 excess cases for ages of 50-59 years to 38 for ages of 70-79 years; for women taking CEE alone, from 19 fewer cases for ages of 50-59 years to 51 excess cases for ages of 70-79 years. Quality-of-life outcomes had mixed results in both trials. Menopausal hormone therapy has a complex pattern of risks and benefits. Findings from the intervention and extended postintervention follow-up of the 2 WHI hormone therapy trials do not support use of this therapy for chronic disease prevention, although it is appropriate for symptom management in some women.

All patients of 70 years old or older were considered seniors and the remaining patients younger than 70 years were considered nonseniors. Patients in the CM five-element music group listened to CM five-element music, the patients in the Western music group listened to Western music, and the patients in the no music group did not listen to music. A course of treatment was 3 weeks, with 30 min each day, 5 days a week. The Hospice Quality of Life Index-Revised (HQOLI-R) and Karnofsky performance score (KPS) were measured in the three groups before and after treatment. The symptom diary score was measured in the three groups every 3 days, 7 times in total. CM five-element music group showed a significant difference of HQOLI-R, KPS and symptom diary score with other groups (all P<0.01).

Two hundred nine cancer survivors \u2265 3 months posttreatment (57% breast cancer) aged 49.5 (\u00b1 10.4) years were assigned to physical exercise (n = 147) or wait-list control (n = 62). QoL, fatigue, emotional distress, physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery were assessed at baseline and post-intervention using questionnaires. Path analysis was conducted using Mplus to explore whether improved physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery mediated the effects of exercise on fatigue and distress and consequently QoL. The intervention was associated with increased physical activity (\u03b2 = 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009= 0.14;0.59), general self-efficacy (\u03b2 = 2.41, 95%CI = 0.35;4.73), and mastery (\u03b2 = 1.75, 95%CI = 0.36;2.78). Further, the intervention had both a direct effect on fatigue (\u03b2 =\u2009-1.09, 95%CI =\u2009-2.12;0.01), and an indirect effect (\u03b2 =\u2009-0.54, 95%CI =\u2009-1.00;-0.21) via physical activity (\u03b2 =\u2009-0.29, 95%CI = -0.64;-0.07) and general self-efficacy (\u03b2 =\u2009-0.25, 95%CI =\u2009-0.61;-0.05). The intervention had a borderline significant direct effect on reduced distress (\u03b2 = -1.32, 95%CI = -2.68;0.11), and a significant indirect effect via increased general self-efficacy and mastery (\u03b2 = -1.06, 95%CI = -1.89;-0.38). Reductions in fatigue (\u03b2 = -1.33, 95%CI\u2009=-1.85;-0.83) and distress (\u03b2 = -0.86, 95%CI = -1.25;-0.52) were associated with improved QoL. Further, increased physical activity was directly associated with improved QoL (\u03b2 = 3.37, 95%CI = 1.01;5.54). The beneficial effect of group-based physical exercise on QoL was mediated by increased physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery, and subsequent reductions in fatigue and distress. In addition to physical activity, future interventions should target self-efficacy and mastery. This may lead to reduced distress and fatigue, and consequently improved QoL of cancer survivors. ",

The aim of this study was to estimate any gain in the quantity and quality of life produced by chemotherapy in these patients. Between January 1991 and February 1995, 61 patients with gastric cancer were randomized to either chemotherapy in addition to best supportive care or to best supportive care. Chemotherapy was allowed in the latter group if the supportive measures did not lead to palliation. Chemotherapy was the ELF-regimen consisting of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and etoposide, or, in elderly patients with poor performance, a 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin regimen (FLv). Quality of life was evaluated with the EORTC-QLQ-C30 instrument. More patients in the chemotherapy group (45%, 14/31) had an improved or prolonged high quality of life for a minimum period of 4 months compared to those in the best supportive care group (20%, 6/30, P < 0.05). A similar difference was seen in the treating physician's evaluation of whether the patient was subjectively improved or continued to do well for at least 4 months (17/31, 55% versus 6/30, 20%, P < 0.01). Overall survival was longer in the chemotherapy group (median 8 vs. 5 months) although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.12). After corrections for imbalances in pretreatment characteristics, chemotherapy treatment was, however, associated with a survival benefit (P = 0.003). Also, the quality-adjusted survival time and time to disease progression were longer for patients randomized to chemotherapy (median 5 vs. 2 months, P = 0.03). The results show that chemotherapy can add to both quantity and quality of life in advanced gastric cancer. The number of patients who benefit from treatment is, however, still rather limited. ",

The intention of this study was to determine if the effects of oral etoposide therapy on survival and quality of life are equivalent to those of intravenous chemotherapy. In a randomized trial of palliative treatment in advanced SCLC, oral etoposide (100 mg given twice daily for 5 days) was compared with intravenous chemotherapy consisting of alternating cycles of cisplatin and etoposide (PE) and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine (CAV). Six cycles of chemotherapy were administered every 21 days in both regimens. Symptom control and quality of life were measured with the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist and a daily diary card. In January 1996, after 155 patients had been randomly assigned from a projected intake of 365 patients, an independent Data Monitoring Committee examined the interim results. Survival was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the logrank test was used to compare treatments. For quality-of-life comparisons, average scores were calculated for each time point. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine any significant overall differences between treatments. For the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist, separate analyses were done for each subset (psychological well-being, physical symptoms, lung cancer symptoms, treatment symptoms, activity, and quality of life). Response rates and toxicity scores were compared by using chi2. All statistical tests were two-sided. Survival was inferior at 1 year in the oral etoposide group compared with intravenous therapy (9.8% for oral versus 19.3% for intravenous; difference = 9.5%; 95% confidence interval of difference = 0.3%-18.7%; P<.05), and there was a trend toward inferior overall survival. Median survival was 4.8 months for oral treatment and 5.9 months for intravenous therapy. Progression-free survival was worse in the oral etoposide arm (median = 3.6 months versus 5.6 months; P<.001), as well as overall response rate (32.9% versus 46.3%; P<.01). With the exception of acute nausea and vomiting associated with intravenous chemotherapy, all aspects of symptom control and quality of life were either the same or worse in the oral etoposide group. Study closure was recommended. These interim results show that this schedule of oral etoposide is inferior to intravenous chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced SCLC and should not be used as first-line treatment of this disease.

Two hundred forty patients were randomised to double-blind MA 480 mg/day, MA 160 mg/day, or matching placebo for 12 weeks. Nutritional status (including weight, skinfold thickness and midarm circumference) and QoL (using 6 linear analogue self-assessment (LASA) scales) were assessed at randomisation and after four, eight and 12 weeks. A QoL ranking incorporating QoL and death was also used ranging from 1 = dead to 5 = much better QoL. One hundred seventy-four patients were assessable at week four, 136 at week eight and 103 patients at week 12. Patients receiving MA reported substantially better appetite (P = 0.001), mood (P = 0.001) and overall quality of life (P < 0.001), and possibly less nausea and vomiting (P = 0.08) than patients receiving placebo, based on a test for trend. A larger benefit was seen with the higher dose which (unlike the lower dose) was significantly better in pairwise comparisons with placebo for appetite, mood and overall QoL (each P < or = 0.001). Despite some missing data on QoL scores, QoL ranking was available on 227 (95%) of patients with significantly higher QoL ranking associated with MA (P = 0.002). Improvements in QoL occurred early within four weeks and were sustained. No statistically significant differences were observed in NS measurements, including weight (P = 0.29). Side effects of therapy were minor and did not differ significantly across treatments. Megestrol acetate given at 480 mg/day is useful palliation in patients with endocrine-insensitive advanced cancer. It improves appetite, mood and overall quality of life in these patients, although not through a direct effect on nutritional status. ",

To broaden the criteria for choice of treatment, we conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial to determine the impact of various gastrectomy procedures on quality of life. Consecutive patients (n = 64) eligible for curative gastric cancer surgery were randomized to have either a total (n = 31) or subtotal (n = 13) gastrectomy or a jejunal S-shaped pouch (n = 20) implanted as a gastric substitute. The quality-of-life evaluation was based on a battery of questionnaires covering both general and specific aspects of life. The patients were rated by one of two psychiatrists who were blinded to the patients' group affiliation. Assessments were made on three occasions: during the week prior to surgery and 3 and 12 months after the surgical intervention. The postoperative complication and mortality rates were similar in all treatment groups, with few serious complications recorded. Irrespective of type of treatment, the patients suffered from alimentary symptoms and functional limitations in everyday life, whereas their mental well-being improved after surgery. Patients who underwent subtotal gastrectomy had the best outcome, especially with respect to complaints of diarrhea. Patients given a gastric substitute after gastrectomy showed no difference from those who had only a total gastrectomy. We conclude that despite significant unfavorable consequences that follow gastrectomy, patients recover with an improved mental status. A pouch reconstruction after total gastrectomy does not improve quality of life, but a subtotal gastrectomy has advantages that must be considered when the procedure is clinically feasible. ",
