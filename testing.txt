Target TANL: Should students be taught to compete or to cooperate ? It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy . In order to survive in the competition , companies continue to improve their products and service , and as a result , the whole society prospers . However , when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation , what we are concerned about is not the whole society , but the development of an individual ' s whole life . From this point of view , I firmly believe that [ we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ through cooperation , children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students | Claim ] . [ What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly , how to get along with others | Premise | Supports = through cooperation , children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students ] . [ During the process of cooperation , children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others , how to communicate with others , how to think comprehensively , and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred | Premise | Supports = through cooperation , children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students ] . [ All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life | Premise | Supports = through cooperation , children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory | Premise | Supports = competition makes the society more effective ] . Hence it is always said that [ competition makes the society more effective | Claim ] . However , [ when we consider about the question that how to win the game , we always find that we need the cooperation | Premise | Supports = without the cooperation , there would be no victory of competition ] . The greater our goal is , the more competition we need . [ Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance , it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach , and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet , and those who are in charge of the medical care | Premise | Supports = without the cooperation , there would be no victory of competition ] . The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team . Therefore [ without the cooperation , there would be no victory of competition | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Consequently , no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that [ a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one ' s success | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: International tourism is now more common than ever before The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights , ancient heritages and different cultures around the world . While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries , I would contend that [ it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists | Premise | Supports = tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country ] . [ Take Cambodia for example , a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants , hotels , souvenir shops and other stores | Premise | Supports = tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country ] . [ These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard | Premise | Supports = tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country ] . Therefore [ tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ through tourism industry , many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected | Premise | Supports = tourism has survived many non - tangible cultural values and beauty scenes ] . For instance , [ in Vietnam , many cultural costumes and natural scenes , namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay , are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry | Premise | Supports = tourism has survived many non - tangible cultural values and beauty scenes ] . [ Without this support and profit from tourism , many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works | Premise | Supports = tourism has survived many non - tangible cultural values and beauty scenes ] . Thus , [ tourism has survived many non - tangible cultural values and beauty scenes | Claim ] .

Target TANL: To conclude , as far as I am concerned , [ international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries | MajorClaim ] . In addition , the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments .

Target TANL: Will newspapers become a thing of the past ? The internet has been more and more popular for recent years , providing people with a huge source of information . As a result of this , print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers . Some people , however , still believe that they can exist for long time ; others disagree , arguing that [ newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence | MajorClaim ] . Personally , I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons .

Target TANL: First of all , [ to obtain information , using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers | Premise | Supports = the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information ] . [ Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper , nowadays , they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet , everywhere and at anytime | Premise | Supports = the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information ] . [ As can be seen , these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world , making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages | Premise | Supports = the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information ] . Hence , [ the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Another point is that , [ from the economic aspect , buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one | Premise | Supports = the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply , possibly leading to the close - downs of many in the coming time ] . It is clear to recognize that [ the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries | Premise | Supports = the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply , possibly leading to the close - downs of many in the coming time ] . The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same , even usually less information than those he can have with the internet ? [ The answer , perhaps , is that hardly would rational people do so | Premise | Supports = the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply , possibly leading to the close - downs of many in the coming time ] . For this reason , [ the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply , possibly leading to the close - downs of many in the coming time | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Last , but not least , [ when taking environment into consideration , people must conceive that the more newspapers are published , the more trees are cut down | Premise | Supports = newspapers ' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive ] . [ This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today | Premise | Supports = newspapers ' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive ] . At this point , [ newspapers ' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media . However , this , if occurring , should be seen as a result of the ever - increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole .

Target TANL: Government budget focus , young children or university ? " Education is the investment in our future " , as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out , education , which fosters a civilized society , plays a significant role in a country ' s long - lasting prosperity . It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development . As for the two integral components within the system , elementary and advanced education , there ' s no doubt that [ a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Concerning that [ elementary education , like the base of a architecture , is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today ' s society | Premise | Supports = if countries , especially the developing countries , are determined to take off , one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education ] , [ government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it | Premise | Supports = if countries , especially the developing countries , are determined to take off , one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education ] . So [ a lack of well - established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy , and this interplay seriously compromises a country ' s future development | Premise | Supports = if countries , especially the developing countries , are determined to take off , one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education ] . In other words , [ if countries , especially the developing countries , are determined to take off , one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education | Claim ] .

Target TANL: That ' s not enough , [ for higher education , which represent the cutting edge of a country ' s academic achievements , act as the vanguard in economic and social advance | Premise | Supports = government ' s big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide ] . [ The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community | Premise | Supports = government ' s big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide ] . [ Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention | Premise | Attacks = government ' s big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide ] , but [ this argument is invalid | Premise | Attacks = Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention ] . [ Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money | Premise | Supports = government ' s big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide ] , what ' s more , [ government ' s big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide | Claim ] .

Target TANL: From reasons listed above , we can safely draw the conclusion that , [ a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities | MajorClaim ] , [ both are crucial on the way to a brighter future | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Roommates quality and their importance Much has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school . Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate . In my personal opinion , [ the most important quality of roommates is being considered | MajorClaim ] . In the meantime , [ communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ Consideration is always important in relationship | Premise | Supports = having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life ] . For example , [ roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time | Premise | Supports = Consideration is always important in relationship ] . [ Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine | Premise | Supports = having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life ] . [ At all times , think about the other ' s feeling before doing any self - centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously | Premise | Supports = having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life ] . Therefore , [ having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life | Claim ] . [ It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member | Premise | Supports = having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , [ communication is as well making a good roommate | Premise | Supports = communication is very important ] . [ People have different habit in daily life , such as tidy the blanket in the morning | Premise | Supports = communication is very important ] . [ One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project | Premise | Supports = communication is very important ] . [ If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk | Premise | Supports = communication is very important ] . Therefore , [ communication is very important | Claim ] as [ it would clear up the misinterpretation | Premise | Supports = communication is very important ] . [ Through communication , bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others | Premise | Supports = communication is very important ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important . [ Consideration and communication , in my personal opinion , are the most important quality | MajorClaim ] . However , people might not get what they want all the time . The sky is the limit ; there are all kinds of personality out there . We need to be flexible to be account into society .

Target TANL: Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways Nowadays transportation has attracted much social concern . Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy . It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that [ governments spend more money on buses , trains , and subways investment | MajorClaim ] . [ Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society | Premise | Supports = they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air ] therefore [ they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air | Claim ] . Both these two things are important .

Target TANL: First and foremost , [ carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere | Premise | Supports = This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere , which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment ] . The fact is that [ the more cars and motorbikes are on roads , the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged | Premise | Supports = This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere , which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment ] . [ If governments use more money to improve roads , there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work | Premise | Supports = This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere , which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment ] . [ This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere , which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment | Claim ] . Whereas , [ if there are more good buses , trains , or subways , people are inclined to use less private vehicles , which decreases the amount of carbon released | Premise | Supports = the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth ] . Obviously , [ the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In addition , [ the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam | Premise | Supports = governments have to turn people ' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes ] . [ It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities | Premise | Supports = governments have to turn people ' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes ] . The main reason for this issue is that [ there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads | Premise | Supports = governments have to turn people ' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes ] . In order to tackle the problem , [ governments have to turn people ' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes | Claim ] . [ There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion | Premise | Supports = governments have to turn people ' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I would concede that [ high - quality roads and highways make it easier to move around | Claim ] . Nevertheless , [ public transportation systems even have more important advantages | MajorClaim ] . [ They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere | Claim ] . That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities .

Target TANL: Physical exercise Although some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics , I truly believe that [ the physical education part should not be outweighed | MajorClaim ] . [ Physical exercises help to create healthy nation , assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country | Claim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , the ancient Latin proverb says : " Anima sana in corpore sano " , which means that [ healthy body is basis for healthy soul | Premise | Supports = if the entire nation , from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday , eventually it may help to build healthy nation ] . [ There is a direct linkage between people ' s health and the frequency of doing physical exercises | Premise | Supports = if the entire nation , from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday , eventually it may help to build healthy nation ] . [ The more we practice , the better we feel | Premise | Supports = if the entire nation , from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday , eventually it may help to build healthy nation ] . Additionally , [ there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity : gradually , step by step we change physical condition to better | Premise | Supports = if the entire nation , from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday , eventually it may help to build healthy nation ] . So , [ if the entire nation , from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday , eventually it may help to build healthy nation | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Besides , [ when we practice outdoors and indoors sports , many aspects are getting clearer | Claim ] . For example , [ when a person goes jogging everyday , eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation | Premise | Supports = when we practice outdoors and indoors sports , many aspects are getting clearer ] . Alike , [ the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically | Premise | Supports = when we practice outdoors and indoors sports , many aspects are getting clearer ] . Furthermore , [ almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation , which is a part of physical education | Premise | Supports = when we practice outdoors and indoors sports , many aspects are getting clearer ] .

Target TANL: Last , but not least , [ financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is | Claim ] . For instance , [ the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare | Premise | Supports = financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is ] , since [ the nation is comparatively healthy | Premise | Supports = the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare ] . Along with that , [ physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development | Premise | Supports = putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society ] . As a matter of fact , [ the better a person feels , the better his brain works | Premise | Supports = putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society ] . Therefore , [ putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society | Claim ] . As hence [ it ends up with financially competitive country | Premise | Supports = putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society ] .

Target TANL: In the conclusion , I would like to say that [ the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education , the more influence we can get on academic success of students | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Advance in transportation and communication like the airplane and the phone Nowadays , everyone can see the effect of technology on their life , especially on the way of transportations and communications such as the airplane and the telephone . There are lots of other effects of growing technology on transportations and communications , which are mentioned as follows .

Target TANL: First and foremost , [ email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology | Claim ] . [ Many years ago , peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters , and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes , and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered | Premise | Supports = email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology ] . But [ nowadays , all people can take advantage of internet to have their own email free , and send their emails to everyone in no time , besides they can be sure if their emails have been delivered or not | Premise | Supports = email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology ] .

Target TANL: [ Another important aspect on technology is transferring money | Premise | Supports = with the advent of internet and online paying systems , you can do many thing at your home easily ] . [ Today , students can apply for foreign universities much easier than before | Premise | Supports = with the advent of internet and online paying systems , you can do many thing at your home easily ] . [ Not only with the help of sending email , but also using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online | Premise | Supports = with the advent of internet and online paying systems , you can do many thing at your home easily ] . Therefore , [ with the advent of internet and online paying systems , you can do many thing at your home easily | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments | Claim ] . [ Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world | Premise | Supports = Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments ] . For example , [ one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries | Premise | Supports = Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments ] . [ In the past time doctors used pig heart ' s valve to implant , but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement | Premise | Supports = Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments ] . [ But now , biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily | Premise | Supports = Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , [ technology has helped us to have more comfortable life | MajorClaim ] . [ You can see its effects on transportation , communication , medicine and so forth | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Technology inspires children ' s creativity instead of weakening it Technology accelerates human ' s evolving pace . With advanced technology , many things that seemed impossible in the past , have become realities . For example , people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen , both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet . However , some people point that technology has made children less creative . I don ' t deny that [ technology may have some negative effects on children | Claim ] , but I think [ technology makes children even more creative | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First , [ technology inspires children to create new things | Premise | Supports = instead of interfering children ' s creativity , technology actually encourages children to learn and to create ] . [ Children are curious about everything around them | Premise | Supports = when they come across a high - tech product like a cellphone , they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works ] , so [ when they come across a high - tech product like a cellphone , they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works | Premise | Supports = instead of interfering children ' s creativity , technology actually encourages children to learn and to create ] . For example , [ Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer , then he did everything he could to understand how it worked | Premise | Supports = instead of interfering children ' s creativity , technology actually encourages children to learn and to create ] . [ After he had figured out all the stuff , he then began to promote the computer | Premise | Supports = instead of interfering children ' s creativity , technology actually encourages children to learn and to create ] . [ In the end , he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight | Premise | Supports = instead of interfering children ' s creativity , technology actually encourages children to learn and to create ] . Therefore , [ instead of interfering children ' s creativity , technology actually encourages children to learn and to create | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ technology widen children ' s knowledge | Premise | Supports = The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world , inspires children and encourage them to create new things ] . [ In the past , children were only able to see things from one perspective | Premise | Supports = The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world , inspires children and encourage them to create new things ] . However , [ with highly advanced technology , children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends | Premise | Supports = they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking ] . Therefore , [ they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking | Premise | Supports = The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world , inspires children and encourage them to create new things ] . [ Knowledge is the base of creativity | Premise | Supports = The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world , inspires children and encourage them to create new things ] . [ The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world , inspires children and encourage them to create new things | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Admittedly , [ technology may have negative effects on children | Claim ] . [ Technology has made life too easy for most children | Premise | Supports = technology may have negative effects on children ] . [ In comfortable conditions , children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change | Premise | Supports = technology may have negative effects on children ] . Nonetheless , [ with the development of technology , increasingly more young people become obsessed with high - tech products | Premise | Attacks = technology may have negative effects on children ] . [ They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Lessons with teachers versus others sources Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations . There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives , such as the Internet , television and cell phone . They all enrich our daily lives . Now , many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful .

Target TANL: Many people find that [ students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers | Claim ] . They argue that [ teachers teach students how to write , read and calculate since they are in kindergarten | Premise | Supports = students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers ] . [ And when they are in primary school , teachers teach them more further knowledge , like writing skills and using computers | Premise | Supports = students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers ] . [ It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling | Premise | Supports = students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers ] . On the other hand , [ students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers | Premise | Supports = students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers ] .

Target TANL: Those who feel that [ students learn far more from other sources , such as the Internet and television | Claim ] , firmly believe that [ within this sources students learn lots of things which they can ' t learn in classes | Premise | Supports = students learn far more from other sources , such as the Internet and television ] . [ They can only input some key words and google it , and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it | Premise | Supports = students learn far more from other sources , such as the Internet and television ] . In this case , [ students learn things easily | Premise | Supports = They can only input some key words and google it , and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it ] . Moreover , [ they contend that good television programs do teach students | Premise | Supports = students learn far more from other sources , such as the Internet and television ] . For instance , [ Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes | Premise | Supports = they contend that good television programs do teach students ] . [ Students have knowledge of others cultures , outer space etc | Premise | Supports = they contend that good television programs do teach students ] .

Target TANL: Personally , I think that [ students learn far more from their teachers than from other source | MajorClaim ] . Because not only do [ teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong | Claim ] . Just imagine : if a student can ' t even make out whether the source is reasonable or not , then how can he get the right information to help him to learn ?

Target TANL: Using animals for the benefit of the human beings With the rapid development of the standard of people ' s life , increasing numbers of animal experiments are done , new medicines and foods , for instance . Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature , however , I believe that no sensible person will deny that [ it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals | MajorClaim ] . In my essay , I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects .

Target TANL: First of all , as we all know , [ animals are friendly and vital for people | Premise | Supports = doing this various testing is a hazard of human ' s future and next generation ] , because [ if there are no animals in the world , the balance of nature will broke down , and we , human , will die out as well | Premise | Supports = animals are friendly and vital for people ] . [ The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals | Premise | Supports = doing this various testing is a hazard of human ' s future and next generation ] . In other words , [ doing this various testing is a hazard of human ' s future and next generation | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Though [ animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance | Premise | Attacks = it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious , and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying ] , [ it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life | Premise | Attacks = animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance ] . To begin with , [ it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious , and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying | Claim ] . [ The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human ' s life | Premise | Supports = it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious , and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying ] . Thus [ even if they are volunteers ; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines | Premise | Supports = it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious , and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying ] . Furthermore , [ it also have potentially harm for human ' s health without any testing | Premise | Supports = it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious , and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , I reaffirm that although [ there is some disadvantages of animals ' profits | Claim ] , [ the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Television is the culprit for destroying communication between friends & family It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television . Nowadays , number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday . Unfortunately , [ most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television | Claim ] . I agree with that idea that [ television devastate families ties | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ In spite of enjoying watching television shows , it is really time consuming task | Claim ] . [ Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising | Premise | Supports = In spite of enjoying watching television shows , it is really time consuming task ] . [ We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities | Premise | Supports = In spite of enjoying watching television shows , it is really time consuming task ] . [ This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday | Premise | Supports = In spite of enjoying watching television shows , it is really time consuming task ] . At the end , [ there is no time for call to our parents or friends | Premise | Supports = In spite of enjoying watching television shows , it is really time consuming task ] .

Target TANL: Second , I think [ watching television programs makes us lazy | Claim ] . [ We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight - hour working in the office | Premise | Supports = watching television programs makes us lazy ] . Hence , [ we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports | Premise | Supports = watching television programs makes us lazy ] . [ This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable | Premise | Supports = watching television programs makes us lazy ] .

Target TANL: Last but not least , [ some television programs have a negative effect on viewers | Claim ] . [ Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity | Premise | Supports = some television programs have a negative effect on viewers ] . [ These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers | Premise | Supports = some television programs have a negative effect on viewers ] . [ They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors | Premise | Supports = some television programs have a negative effect on viewers ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , [ killing our time , making us lazy , and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive | Claim ] . I think [ it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Gender Equality at university admission Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field . Contrastingly , in the past time , women worked at home and performed sophisticated work . This factor is still affecting thinking of many people . They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only . This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender .

Target TANL: [ Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders | Claim ] . Initially , if we look into the fact , [ women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor | Premise | Supports = Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders ] . For example , [ nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky | Premise | Supports = women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor ] . [ They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also | Premise | Supports = women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor ] . Furthermore , [ university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination | Premise | Supports = Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders ] . [ They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission | Premise | Supports = university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination ] .

Target TANL: However , [ the current job market affects the decision of universities | Premise | Supports = universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender ] . [ Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers | Premise | Supports = universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender ] . [ The job selection criteria are pre decided | Premise | Supports = universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender ] . For instance [ employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine | Premise | Supports = The job selection criteria are pre decided ] . [ They prefer male staff for night shifts | Premise | Supports = employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine ] . [ They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling , teaching , designing etc | Premise | Supports = employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine ] . Therefore , [ universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender | Claim ] .

Target TANL: To conclude , I strongly believe that [ universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject | MajorClaim ] . [ Our youth has become very confident towards his career | Premise | Supports = we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal ] . [ They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations | Premise | Supports = we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal ] . [ Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer | Premise | Supports = we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal ] . So [ we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Some young adults want independence from their parents quickly Many young adults want to get away from their parent ' s houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits , to be independent . But these young people do not take into account that [ their lives are going to be more difficult , when they are away from home | Claim ] . [ They will have to pay a lot of bills | Premise | Supports = their lives are going to be more difficult , when they are away from home ] , because [ they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co - tenant , who they may not like | Premise | Supports = their lives are going to be more difficult , when they are away from home ] .

Target TANL: [ Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money | Claim ] . [ If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan , electricity , water or even for a meal | Premise | Supports = Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money ] . [ If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working | Premise | Supports = Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money ] , because [ they will not have money to pay for everything | Premise | Supports = If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working ] . [ There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home | Premise | Supports = Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money ] , because [ parents will take care for them | Premise | Supports = There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home ] . Moreover , [ parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying | Premise | Supports = Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money ] .

Target TANL: [ Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co - tenant , who they do not like | Claim ] . [ His habits may be totally different from theirs , his behavior may be inappropriate , but they will have to live with him or even share a room , in order to have less expenses | Premise | Supports = Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co - tenant , who they do not like ] . [ Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults | Premise | Supports = Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co - tenant , who they do not like ] . [ When the co - tenant do not share their interests and points of view , they will not be able to ask him for advice | Premise | Supports = Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co - tenant , who they do not like ] . Furthermore , [ they are most likely to quarrel every day , instead of to help each other | Premise | Supports = Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co - tenant , who they do not like ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I reckon that [ for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents | MajorClaim ] , because of the benefits they will have . [ They will not need to worry about financial problems or if they will get on well with their roommate | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Air pollution Air pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way . I believe that [ more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First , [ in most industrialized countries , there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions | Premise | Supports = If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution , they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause ] . [ The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution | Premise | Supports = If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution , they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause ] . [ While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses , most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution | Premise | Supports = If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution , they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause ] . [ If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution , they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating | Premise | Supports = by charging private individuals for causing air pollution , that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution ] . [ As house heating is a major need in the winter time , some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes | Premise | Supports = by charging private individuals for causing air pollution , that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution ] . Instead of this , [ some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution | Premise | Supports = by charging private individuals for causing air pollution , that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution ] . In my opinion , [ by charging private individuals for causing air pollution , that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution | Claim ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , I believe that [ governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies | Claim ] . [ Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air , instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , due to the fact that [ governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution | Claim ] , [ both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Young people should go to university or not Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university . In regard to the development of the country , some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities , while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment . In this essay , I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool - proof decision .

Target TANL: To begin with , those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons . From their point of view , the fact is that [ there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation , such as mechanics , sales persons , or engineers | Premise | Supports = it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs , even can be a sheer time - consuming ] , and , furthermore , [ labors for graduates are in short supply | Premise | Supports = it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs , even can be a sheer time - consuming ] . What is worse , [ the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying | Premise | Supports = it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs , even can be a sheer time - consuming ] . In this regard [ it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs , even can be a sheer time - consuming | Claim ] .

Target TANL: However , on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition , saying that [ universities provide not only skills for careers , but also academic knowledge for the human race , such as bio science , politics , and medicine | Claim ] . [ These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world | Premise | Supports = universities provide not only skills for careers , but also academic knowledge for the human race , such as bio science , politics , and medicine ] . More importantly , [ many researches in the ivory - tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society | Premise | Supports = universities provide not only skills for careers , but also academic knowledge for the human race , such as bio science , politics , and medicine ] . Another significant factor of universities is that [ diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently | Premise | Supports = universities provide not only skills for careers , but also academic knowledge for the human race , such as bio science , politics , and medicine ] because [ there are a number of chances through internships , deeper discussion , independent life , and exchange scholarships | Premise | Supports = diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently ] .

Target TANL: To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities ' education have reasonable justifications ; however , I agree with the latter view . Although [ higher education does not guarantee young students ' success | Claim ] , [ the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Effects of mobile phones Nowadays , the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well , such as social , medical and technical problems . However , [ I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones | MajorClaim ] . In this essay , I would like to analyze these three issues in order to support my viewpoint .

Target TANL: First of all , [ almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems | Claim ] . Mobile phones are not out of expectation . [ Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas , such as schools , libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive | Premise | Supports = almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems ] . What is worse , [ some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other | Premise | Supports = almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems ] . Nevertheless , [ it is not impossible to solve these problems , as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented | Premise | Attacks = almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems ] .

Target TANL: It is also worth mentioning that [ some harmful effects on our health are lethal | Claim ] . [ It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers , although the further investigation are needed | Premise | Supports = some harmful effects on our health are lethal ] .

Target TANL: Another debatable problem is about techniques . [ There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party | Claim ] . [ This possibility exists all the time | Premise | Supports = There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party ] . But [ a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users | Premise | Attacks = There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , [ the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people ' s daily life | Claim ] . [ Not only used for communication , but it also functions as an Internet browser , a music player , a personal organizer and so forth | Premise | Supports = the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people ' s daily life ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , nothing can be overused without side effects . [ The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people ' s dependence on it is irreversible | MajorClaim ] , although [ it has a number of problems that should be well handled | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Influence of large factories Nowadays , whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society . Out of the case of economic development , industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society . However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution . From my point of view , [ the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages , if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate | Claim ] . [ To manufacture goods , there must be the demand of laborers , from which the local residents can benefit | Premise | Supports = a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate ] . What is more , [ the factory is not isolated , other industries and business will be quickly established , resulting in economic growth of local area | Premise | Supports = a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate ] . For example , [ the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers ' accommodation need | Premise | Supports = the factory is not isolated , other industries and business will be quickly established , resulting in economic growth of local area ] .

Target TANL: [ The main disadvantage is contamination | Claim ] . [ It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry , such as water pollution , overcrowded traffic and medical problems | Premise | Supports = The main disadvantage is contamination ] . For instance , [ in some industrial cities , a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems , such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances | Premise | Supports = It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry , such as water pollution , overcrowded traffic and medical problems ] .

Target TANL: However , [ it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society | Premise | Supports = how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it ] . Therefore , [ how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it | Claim ] . In fact [ most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well | Premise | Supports = how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries . Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way .

Target TANL: Prepared Food Nowadays , more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals , since [ it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society | Claim ] . However [ it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients , ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people ' s eating habits | MajorClaim ] . In this essay , I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above .

Target TANL: First of all , [ to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious , almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people | Premise | Supports = easy - to - cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human ' s health ] . Some [ ingredients being added have caused dire consequences | Premise | Supports = easy - to - cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human ' s health ] . For instance , [ there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases | Premise | Supports = ingredients being added have caused dire consequences ] . Thus , [ easy - to - cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human ' s health | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition | Claim ] . It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food . [ Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need , especially for children who are growing up | Premise | Supports = Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition ] .

Target TANL: In addition , cooking is one of arts humans create . [ The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose | Claim ] . [ At the increasing living pace , the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes | Premise | Supports = The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose ] . But [ rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits , which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking | Premise | Supports = The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , although [ the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work | Claim ] , [ it is not a good thing | MajorClaim ] . Cooking is not a waste of time , contrarily , it is crucial for our health and culture .

Target TANL: Financial aid to develop countries As is commonly understood , there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries . It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries . However , [ it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries | MajorClaim ] . This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ education is an essential part in development | Premise | Supports = if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education , the developing countries will remain undeveloped , even though they gain a great deal of economic support ] . For instance , [ most developing countries are lack of educational resources , such as experienced teachers , evaluation systems and teaching facilities , which is usually neglected by local authorities | Premise | Supports = education is an essential part in development ] . From this example , it is obvious that [ if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education , the developing countries will remain undeveloped , even though they gain a great deal of economic support | Claim ] . Thus , [ the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid | Premise | Supports = if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education , the developing countries will remain undeveloped , even though they gain a great deal of economic support ] .

Target TANL: In addition , it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world . This means [ some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market | Premise | Supports = developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries ] . Indeed , [ they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas | Premise | Supports = developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries ] . Therefore , [ developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries | MajorClaim ] . And [ it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Society should ban all forms of the advertising It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life . We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday . Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing . Other critics say that ads have no purpose , they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned . On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way . [ Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , I do support the idea that [ advertising alcohol , cigarettes , goods and services with adult content should be prohibited | Claim ] because [ these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children | Premise | Supports = advertising alcohol , cigarettes , goods and services with adult content should be prohibited ] . [ Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis | Premise | Supports = advertising alcohol , cigarettes , goods and services with adult content should be prohibited ] . Fortunately , [ some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol , cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries | Premise | Supports = advertising alcohol , cigarettes , goods and services with adult content should be prohibited ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand [ by advertising companies , businesses , firms and individuals promote their goods and services | Claim ] . [ Thanks to ads we learn about new products , we can compare them and choose what’s the best for us | Premise | Supports = by advertising companies , businesses , firms and individuals promote their goods and services ] .

Target TANL: [ These days , not only many businesses , but also governments have to rely on advertising | Claim ] . For example , [ tourism makes up one - third of the Czech Republic ' s economy | Premise | Supports = These days , not only many businesses , but also governments have to rely on advertising ] . [ In order to promote the country ' s attractions , the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers | Premise | Supports = These days , not only many businesses , but also governments have to rely on advertising ] . [ Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country | Premise | Supports = These days , not only many businesses , but also governments have to rely on advertising ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I think that [ modern society needs advertising | MajorClaim ] . [ Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services | Claim ] , but we should also bear in mind that [ advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Do married women usually work ? Why and why not ? Personally , I believe that [ married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly | MajorClaim ] . [ Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household | Claim ] . I will mention some basic reasons as following .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ extra income that women earn will contribute to their family ' s expenses | Premise | Supports = it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money ] . [ By taking up a job , a wife can earn more money to support her family life | Premise | Supports = it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money ] . [ This is really necessary in cases of her husband ' s low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present | Premise | Supports = it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money ] . So , [ it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world , strengthen their character and show their capacity | Premise | Supports = it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better ] . [ These things in turn will make them more confident , independent | Premise | Supports = it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better ] . [ These women will set a good example for their children | Premise | Supports = it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better ] . Therefore , [ it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Last but not least , nowadays , [ there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work | Claim ] . [ Besides the gorvernment ' s policies on limited families and their husbands ' sharing in the housework , many employers are willing to offer part - time jobs for women | Premise | Supports = there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ a well - organized home does not need the housewife ' s presence the whole day long | Claim ] and [ married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Government and education Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world . I completely agree that [ government should provide those education to their people ; however , for the more higher education like university , the students or their parents should pay for the fees | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees | Claim ] . In the other hand , [ I don ' t think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students ' primary and secondary education | Claim ] . [ It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students ' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education | Premise | Supports = I don ' t think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students ' primary and secondary education ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , [ students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part - time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it | Premise | Supports = They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves ] . [ They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves | Claim ] . In addition to that , [ the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well | Premise | Supports = They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , [ this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives | Claim ] as [ they need to make some contribution too for their children future | Premise | Supports = this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I completely agree that [ government should not pay for the university fees | MajorClaim ] because [ this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Alternative forms of transport to alleviate traffic congestion Recently , a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation . Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation , while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution . In my opinion , I strongly agree that [ alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced | MajorClaim ] . In this essay , several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution | Premise | Supports = it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles ] . Since [ automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air | Premise | Supports = the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants ] , [ the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants | Premise | Supports = it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles ] . Therefore , [ it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion | Premise | Supports = the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented ] . [ Once we get into the traffic jam , it forces us to waste our time for a while | Premise | Supports = the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented ] . What is worse , [ traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result , it leads to an increase of traffic accidents | Premise | Supports = the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented ] . Thus , [ the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In order to solve these problems , [ alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively | Claim ] . With regard to the former , [ alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal | Premise | Supports = alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively ] . For example , [ rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries | Premise | Supports = alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal ] . [ This system is that at the corner of each district , the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee | Premise | Supports = alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal ] . Since [ bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses | Premise | Supports = it is a better form to protect environment than automobile ] , [ it is a better form to protect environment than automobile | Premise | Supports = alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal ] . As for the latter point , [ the introduction of international laws can be also effective | Premise | Supports = alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively ] . For instance , [ there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only | Premise | Supports = the introduction of international laws can be also effective ] . Thus , [ these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution | Premise | Supports = the introduction of international laws can be also effective ] .

Target TANL: In summary , even though [ some people claim the convenience of automobile | Claim ] , I would state that [ alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Giving aid to poorer countries has more negative effects than positive effect In this world , there is no one who does not know this world ' globalization ' , which means the world are more closer , and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways . That is why governmental and non - governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries . It is true that [ just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries | Claim ] . In addition , [ a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries | Claim ] . However , I agree that [ aiding poor countries has positive effects , overweighing its side - effects for the several reasons | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer | Premise | Supports = Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business ] . [ To be out of poverty , it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light , electricity , load , highways , natural resources , technology and buildings for companies | Premise | Supports = Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business ] . [ Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business | Claim ] . In actual , [ republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960 ' s | Premise | Supports = Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business ] . [ Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties | Premise | Supports = Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people | Claim ] . [ If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases , they would never take their abundance for granted | Premise | Supports = aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people ] . [ It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love , but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization | Premise | Supports = aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people ] .

Target TANL: Third , [ the campaigns might include practical benefits | Claim ] . [ In globalized world , the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others | Premise | Supports = the campaigns might include practical benefits ] . [ When America mortgage loan system went bad , several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated , even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt | Premise | Supports = the campaigns might include practical benefits ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid ; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people , keeping strong global economy | Claim ] . I strongly believe that [ being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers , and it will make the earth a better place to live | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Effects of globalization During the history of the world , every change has its own positive and negative sides . Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception . Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world ; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress | MajorClaim ] . I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them .

Target TANL: Study at school or get a job ? Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future . Others , however , think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job . Personally , I tend to agree with the point of view that [ student have to be forced to study at school | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying | Premise | Supports = they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future ] . [ It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things | Premise | Supports = schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying ] . Second of all , [ schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students | Premise | Supports = they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future ] . [ Students may learn professional skills , expand their understandings and gain experiences | Premise | Supports = schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students ] . Therefore , [ they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future | Claim ] . For example , as we know , [ employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills | Premise | Supports = they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future ] .

Target TANL: Nevertheless , it is not unreasonable that some people think that [ children should interrupt their school work and get a job | Claim ] . [ Whether children can learn a lot at school | Premise | Attacks = there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future ] , [ there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future | Premise | Supports = children should interrupt their school work and get a job ] . Furthermore , [ children can learn social skills when they have a job | Premise | Supports = children should interrupt their school work and get a job ] .

Target TANL: High sales reflect power of advertising and not the real need Nowadays , we can see advertisements everywhere , from television set to posters on the streets . Some people believe that [ these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television | MajorClaim ] . I tend to agree with this view .

Target TANL: [ To boost their sales and win over customers , companies pour a great amount of money into advertising | Premise | Supports = it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product ] . Most of the time , [ it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product | Claim ] . By which I mean , [ huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product | Premise | Supports = it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product ] . [ By casting famous singers in their television advertisement , motorcycles or clothes for example , sales increase significantly | Premise | Supports = it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product ] since [ youngsters , as the target consumers , love celebrities | Premise | Supports = By casting famous singers in their television advertisement , motorcycles or clothes for example , sales increase significantly ] . Since [ having these products shows their status | Premise | Supports = the quality obviously is not relatively important ] , [ the quality obviously is not relatively important | Premise | Supports = it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product ] .

Target TANL: However , despite the fact that [ advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated | Premise | Attacks = it plays and important role economically ] , it is also true that [ it plays and important role economically | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Gun control Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society , which is strictly controlled in most countries . However , gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others . Therefore , this is still a controversial topic around the world . From my point of view , [ it is sensible to enforce the gun control | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns . [ The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns | Premise | Attacks = the fewer guns possessed , the fewer accidents would happened , our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates ] . For example , [ we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting | Premise | Supports = the fewer guns possessed , the fewer accidents would happened , our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates ] . So [ the fewer guns possessed , the fewer accidents would happened , our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns , especially in some countries where guns are available for people | Claim ] . Eventually , [ guns will create a violent society if the trend continues | Premise | Supports = most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns , especially in some countries where guns are available for people ] . Take an example , [ in American , young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns , which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting | Premise | Supports = most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns , especially in some countries where guns are available for people ] . What is worse , [ some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police , which makes citizens always live in danger | Premise | Supports = most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns , especially in some countries where guns are available for people ] .

Target TANL: Why should human beings travel to outer space ? For many centuries , outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study . Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful . However , a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money , to illustrate , astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment . On the other hand , [ there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ many facts about solar system can be discovered | Claim ] . For instance , [ a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round , not flat | Premise | Supports = many facts about solar system can be discovered ] . Another example is that [ it is the earth which goes around the sun , not vice versa | Premise | Supports = many facts about solar system can be discovered ] . [ If it was not for the space exploration , we would never know these facts | Premise | Supports = many facts about solar system can be discovered ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ people can know more about the planet earth itself | Claim ] . [ By observing planet earth from outer space , people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth | Premise | Supports = people can know more about the planet earth itself ] . [ With this knowledge , people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming | Premise | Supports = people can know more about the planet earth itself ] .

Target TANL: Finally , [ a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented | Claim ] . [ As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in , scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks | Premise | Supports = a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented ] . [ Oxygen tanks , for instance , are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater | Premise | Supports = a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented ] . Moreover , [ spaceships , communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society | Premise | Supports = a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented ] .

Target TANL: As a conclusion , I personally think that [ human beings should travel to outer space | MajorClaim ] . In spite of costing a fortune , space exploration has given aforementioned benefits .

Target TANL: Benefits of students doing extra jobs In present day and age , students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university . This phenomenon , although in some extents , are proved to have negative effects , I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages . In this essay , some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained .

Target TANL: [ It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs | Premise | Supports = having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation ] . [ Part - time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities | Premise | Supports = having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation ] . In addition , [ that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities | Premise | Supports = students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands - on experience ] . As a result , [ students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands - on experience | Premise | Supports = having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation ] . Moreover , [ having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones | Claim ] . [ By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation , then students ' confidence could be significantly gained | Premise | Supports = students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones ] . Also , [ working conditions require students the independency in thinking , working , and solving problems , which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities | Premise | Supports = students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones ] .

Target TANL: Lastly , [ doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation | Claim ] . Indeed , [ high studying tuition , added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students | Premise | Supports = doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation ] . [ With the money they earn from extra jobs , which normally is not much , those difficulties could be partially solved | Premise | Supports = doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation ] . Moreover , [ that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well - prepared condition for their independent later life | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I feel certain that [ having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits | MajorClaim ] . [ By taking on an extra job , students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience , confidence and accommodation | Claim ] . It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future .

Target TANL: Benefits of students ' unpaid work The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries . In this essay , I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies , and then I would draw a conclusion at the end .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to | Claim ] . [ In most school curriculums , the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom | Premise | Supports = students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation ] . As a result , [ students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation | Premise | Supports = the internship , although without pay , can give them the experiences that money cannot buy ] . For this reason , [ the internship , although without pay , can give them the experiences that money cannot buy | Premise | Supports = students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to ] .

Target TANL: [ As for the companies , the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money | Premise | Supports = companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation ] . In addition , [ the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination , which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan | Premise | Supports = companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation ] . Moreover [ they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training | Premise | Supports = companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation ] . Therefore , [ companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation | Claim ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , [ students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past . It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco - friendly . I will analyze these areas in the essay .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ the major source of energy today is water | Premise | Supports = it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources ] . Although [ there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source | Premise | Supports = it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources ] . [ To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short | Premise | Supports = during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India ] . Thus , [ during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India | Premise | Supports = it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources ] . [ If the government encourage the use of nuclear , solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity | Premise | Supports = it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources ] . Therefore , [ it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming | Claim ] . For example , [ the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming | Premise | Supports = the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming ] . In the same way , [ the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro - kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution | Premise | Supports = the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming ] .

Target TANL: To conclude , [ it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy | MajorClaim ] . [ This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming | Claim ] . Further , government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy .

Target TANL: Should governments be responsible to help the unemployed and homeless Unemployment is clearly a global problem , be it in developed countries or developing ones . However , I tend to believe [ it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens , rather than the government , to help them out | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only | Claim ] . [ Tax revenue is collected from those who works | Premise | Supports = Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only ] . [ Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers | Premise | Supports = Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only ] . Besides , [ there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure , such as health care service and education | Premise | Supports = addressing unemployment should have low priority ] , so [ addressing unemployment should have low priority | Premise | Supports = Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only ] .

Target TANL: Also , it is obvious that , [ to survive in this competitive world , one has to work hard and equip themselves well | Claim ] . [ If they could get free financial help from the government , they might end up with out any motivation to work at all | Premise | Supports = to survive in this competitive world , one has to work hard and equip themselves well ] .

Target TANL: Of course , [ this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance | Claim ] . [ They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support | Premise | Supports = this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance ] . In this case , [ the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest - free bank loans for them , so that they can have the chance to get back to work | Premise | Supports = this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance ] . After all , [ it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again | Premise | Supports = this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , my point of view is that , although [ the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people | Claim ] , [ direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: True function of a university Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise . Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts : where more and more is known about less and less . Nevertheless , among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job - seeking and other aspects in everyday life . However , although I respect the universities ' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause , I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university .

Target TANL: [ A university , in common sense , is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge | Claim ] . What is meant by this is that [ students are the ones universities should really cater for , not the employers | Premise | Supports = A university , in common sense , is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge ] , as [ students are the ones here to seek knowledge | Premise | Supports = students are the ones universities should really cater for , not the employers ] . [ High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons : a degree that ' s more widely accepted , gain knowledge and insight into an industry , or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field | Premise | Supports = A university , in common sense , is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather | Premise | Supports = a university should provide access to information , rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers ' taste ] . [ It is , therefore , not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university , but instead , these must be made available when needed | Premise | Supports = a university should provide access to information , rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers ' taste ] . So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that [ a university should provide access to information , rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers ' taste | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources | MajorClaim ] . It would be helpful , however , if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures .

Target TANL: Zoos should be built to protect rural animals Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate , with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals , while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos . From my perspective , [ animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings | Premise | Supports = it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in ] . [ Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals | Premise | Supports = it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in ] , [ it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in | Claim ] . Apparently , [ the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss | Premise | Supports = zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives ] . Moreover , [ if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period , it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures | Premise | Supports = zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives ] . As a result , [ the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression | Premise | Supports = zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives ] . It seems that [ zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Nevertheless , supporters would argue that [ zoos , which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals , would provide better care for the animals inside | Claim ] . They further point out that [ the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting | Premise | Supports = zoos , which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals , would provide better care for the animals inside ] . However , I would contend that [ the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat | Premise | Attacks = the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting ] . It seems that [ the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide | Premise | Attacks = zoos , which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals , would provide better care for the animals inside ] .

Target TANL: By way of conclusion , it is my belief that [ wild animals should be set free from zoos | MajorClaim ] not only because [ they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Distance - learning vs . attending school in person A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance - learning should be promoted as much as possible , or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees . From my perspective , [ online - teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ distance - learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world | Claim ] . [ In earlier times , students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby , regardless of any differences in teaching facilities , teacher ' s qualifications or the school reputation | Premise | Supports = distance - learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world ] . [ Now , however , students are able to apply for online - courses provided by top - of - the - range universities and colleges worldwide | Premise | Supports = distance - learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world ] . Furthermore , [ the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students | Premise | Supports = educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher - student ratios ] . Consequently , [ educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher - student ratios | Claim ] . [ Thanks to the economical online - teaching , universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains | Premise | Supports = educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher - student ratios ] .

Target TANL: Nevertheless , opponents of online - degrees would argue that [ attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates | Claim ] . [ They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life | Premise | Supports = attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates ] . [ It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive | Premise | Supports = attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates ] .

Target TANL: By way of conclusion , it is my belief that [ distance - learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases | MajorClaim ] . However , discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished .

Target TANL: Do modern communication technologies benefit all people Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones , e - mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years . Yet , there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative . Although [ there are valid arguments to the contrary | Claim ] , it is my belief that [ the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business | Premise | Supports = these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind ] . [ With the click of a button , the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds | Premise | Supports = these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind ] . Furthermore , [ it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world | Premise | Supports = these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind ] . [ With a mobile phone or a laptop , a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop , in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine | Premise | Supports = these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind ] . Therefore , it seems that [ these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Nevertheless , opponents of modern communications claim that only [ the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits | Premise | Supports = people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies ] . They further point out that [ the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money | Premise | Supports = people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies ] . [ Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services | Premise | Supports = people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies ] . Consequently , [ people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies | Claim ] .

Target TANL: By way of conclusion , I believe that [ modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases | MajorClaim ] ; however , the have - nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn ' t afford it .

Target TANL: Should high school make music lessons compulsory Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject , while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional . In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides .

Target TANL: [ It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology | Premise | Supports = many university authorities provide music lessons for their students ] . Therefore , [ many university authorities provide music lessons for their students | Claim ] so that [ they live and study in a harmony with music | Premise | Supports = many university authorities provide music lessons for their students ] . I have an impression that [ students , who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time | Premise | Supports = many university authorities provide music lessons for their students ] . In this case , [ music can be a useful and interesting solution | Premise | Supports = many university authorities provide music lessons for their students ] . Moreover , [ if musical activity involves many participants , there will be co - operation and developed team work in the group , which is , of course , beneficial in their future life | Premise | Supports = many university authorities provide music lessons for their students ] . In fact , [ students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music | Premise | Supports = many university authorities provide music lessons for their students ] . Consequently , [ the calm atmosphere in the class might be created | Premise | Supports = many university authorities provide music lessons for their students ] .

Target TANL: By contrast , [ it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students | Premise | Supports = music and other entertaining subjects should be optional ] . In our hectic life , however , [ demand is not for musically orientated students , but for academically developed employees | Premise | Supports = music and other entertaining subjects should be optional ] . Hence , I agree with the majority , because [ music is the art which requires special attitude towards it | Premise | Supports = music and other entertaining subjects should be optional ] . Increasingly however , [ students can not obtain supposed impacts , unless they get interested in it more seriously | Premise | Supports = music and other entertaining subjects should be optional ] . Therefore , [ music and other entertaining subjects should be optional | Claim ] . [ Nowadays , time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace | Premise | Supports = music and other entertaining subjects should be optional ] . To my mind , [ students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation - related subjects , rather than playing on guitar or singing a song | Premise | Supports = music and other entertaining subjects should be optional ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I think that in order to be a competitive worker , students must know their field in an advanced level . On the other hand , [ music can help an individual to shape its character | Claim ] . [ An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Universities should give money to sport activities or libraries Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success . Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities . In my opinion [ universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First , I think [ a library is vital and strategical part of a university | Premise | Supports = All professors and students need to have a modern and well - equipped library ] . [ All professors and students need to have a modern and well - equipped library | Claim ] because , [ after internet , library plays an important role in research | Premise | Supports = All professors and students need to have a modern and well - equipped library ] . Although [ sport is important | Premise | Attacks = it does not have the same priority of library has ] , [ it does not have the same priority of library has | Claim ] . In addition [ only small part of students attend sport activities | Premise | Supports = it does not have the same priority of library has ] . For example , [ in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities | Premise | Supports = it does not have the same priority of library has ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ usually libraries do not have income | Premise | Supports = universities support is vital for libraries ] . [ Most libraries are free not for students also for public | Premise | Supports = universities support is vital for libraries ] . Hence , [ universities support is vital for libraries | Premise | Supports = there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses , but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income ] . But [ sport activities have a good income | Premise | Supports = there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses , but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income ] because [ every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors | Premise | Supports = sport activities have a good income ] . Also , [ they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets | Premise | Supports = sport activities have a good income ] . To conclude , [ there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses , but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Last but not least , [ investing in libraries has a long - time result | Claim ] . For example , [ a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers | Premise | Supports = investing in libraries has a long - time result ] . [ Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time | Premise | Supports = investing in libraries has a long - time result ] . Besides , [ in the far future , they become more valuable | Premise | Supports = investing in libraries has a long - time result ] . On the other side , [ most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short - time and they are not persistent for a long - time | Premise | Supports = investing in libraries has a long - time result ] .

Target TANL: In spite of the importance of sports activities , [ libraries are more important | MajorClaim ] . [ They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit ? Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain . He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself . Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs , while others are concerned that animals should not be misused . This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication .

Target TANL: [ Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as , cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them | Claim ] . [ Likewise , other animals such as , horses , cattles and donkeys for farming , agriculture and as a mode of transportation | Premise | Supports = Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as , cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them ] . [ Many people keep pets like dogs and cats , trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples | Premise | Supports = Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as , cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them ] . [ They are kept for security purposes in houses | Premise | Supports = Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as , cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits | Claim ] . For instance , [ cows are often injected by Oxytocin , a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation | Premise | Supports = many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits ] . [ This in turn , causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle | Premise | Supports = many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits ] . Furthermore , [ thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products | Claim ] . [ Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights | Premise | Supports = many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits ] . [ Many other practices like , equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster | Premise | Supports = many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits ] . [ And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals | Premise | Supports = many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits ] .

Target TANL: From my prospective , [ human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters | MajorClaim ] . [ Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior | Claim ] and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime .

Target TANL: Museums and art galleries will disappear soon ? It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology ; therefore , some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon . Although modern technology make it possible , I still believe [ some museums and art galleries will not disappear | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: On the one hand , [ technology indeed simplifies people ' s life all the time | Premise | Supports = people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home , save the time and money on the road , which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society ] . Obviously , [ people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home , save the time and money on the road , which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society | Claim ] . However , [ in accordance with recent research , experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy | Premise | Attacks = people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home , save the time and money on the road , which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society ] because [ they lack of physical exercise and face - to - face communication | Premise | Supports = in accordance with recent research , experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture | Claim ] . First of all , [ authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos | Premise | Supports = the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture ] . [ It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos , so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it | Premise | Supports = the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture ] . Furthermore , [ museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages | Premise | Supports = these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture ] ; therefore , [ these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I admit that [ modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions | Claim ] , but [ museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Influence of English - advantages outweigh the disadvantages In the present age , it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English . Some people claim [ it ' s a reasonable loss in globalization | MajorClaim ] while others argue the demerits exceed the merits . Personally , I agree with the former opinion .

Target TANL: [ No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally | Claim ] . To begin with , [ communication between countries and cultures become convenient | Premise | Supports = No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally ] . [ In my country , English is a required course from elementary school | Premise | Supports = studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters ] . Thus , [ studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters | Premise | Supports = communication between countries and cultures become convenient ] . For them , [ language obstacle is no longer a problem , which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country | Premise | Supports = enhances relationship and promotes international business ] . This , in turn , [ enhances relationship and promotes international business | Premise | Supports = communication between countries and cultures become convenient ] . Furthermore , [ researchers , especially those who work on high - tech , would have wider range of references if they are good at English | Premise | Supports = No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally ] . [ Taking IT industry for an example , top technical science is published in English | Premise | Supports = researchers , especially those who work on high - tech , would have wider range of references if they are good at English ] . [ It ' s neither to get a translated version of these articles , nor to always have a translator besides | Premise | Supports = they have no choice but choosing English as a second language ] . As a result , [ they have no choice but choosing English as a second language | Premise | Supports = researchers , especially those who work on high - tech , would have wider range of references if they are good at English ] .

Target TANL: Admittedly , opponents may blame that [ English is making lesser - known languages disappear ever year | Premise | Supports = the culture heritage and nation identity vanish ] . Hence , [ the culture heritage and nation identity vanish | Claim ] . However , [ this is really short - sighted , ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society | Premise | Attacks = the culture heritage and nation identity vanish ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , in spite of some negative effects , [ I ' m totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around | MajorClaim ] . I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization . But at the same time , actions , like recording , can be taken to protect native languages and cultures .

Target TANL: Creativity - should it be given freedom or restrictions Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious . Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds . [ Creativity originates in a free mind | Claim ] . Hence , [ creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ Time and again , creative artists like Michaelangelo , Picasso , Salman Rushdie , Shakespeare etc . have made artistic works which gave a social message | Premise | Supports = Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message ] . [ Right from sculptures to paintings , books to drama and movies , all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras | Premise | Supports = Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message ] . [ Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Nonetheless , [ innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience | Claim ] . [ It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments | Premise | Supports = innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience ] . For instance , [ Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government , just because she raised a social issue | Premise | Supports = It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments ] . [ This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds | Premise | Supports = It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments ] . In addition , [ creativity also gives aesthetic charm | Premise | Supports = innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience ] .

Target TANL: Unfortunately , many governments restrict the artists . [ Frank Zappa once said , " Mind is like a parachute , it doesn ' t work if its not open“ | Premise | Supports = Like the media , artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely ] . [ Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains | Premise | Supports = Like the media , artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely ] . [ Like the media , artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely | Claim ] .

Target TANL: However , [ artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people | Premise | Supports = Artists should have self - awareness not to create vulgar , hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose ] . [ Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people | Premise | Supports = Artists should have self - awareness not to create vulgar , hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose ] . [ Artists should have self - awareness not to create vulgar , hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose | Claim ] . I firmly believe that [ artists should be given the freedom of expression | MajorClaim ] . [ Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries | Claim ] . [ Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Competition or co - operation - which is better The modern society is full of cut - throat competition . Some people think that inculcating co - operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed . However , co - operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle .

Target TANL: [ Co - operation is essential for teamwork | Claim ] . [ Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co - operative approach in children | Premise | Supports = Co - operation is essential for teamwork ] . [ We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success | Premise | Supports = Co - operation is essential for teamwork ] . [ A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself | Premise | Supports = Co - operation is essential for teamwork ] . For instance , [ lions hunt in a team | Premise | Supports = Co - operation is essential for teamwork ] . [ It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy | Premise | Supports = lions hunt in a team ] . In the same way , [ co - operative approach will save time , energy and will have a higher success rate | Premise | Supports = Co - operation is essential for teamwork ] .

Target TANL: Nevertheless , [ co - operation helps to understand other ' s perspective and learn by their mistakes | Claim ] . [ It helps to identify one ' s strengths and weaknesses as compared to others | Premise | Supports = co - operation helps to understand other ' s perspective and learn by their mistakes ] . [ A co - operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people ' s achievements | Premise | Supports = co - operation helps to understand other ' s perspective and learn by their mistakes ] . However , [ competition is also as important as co - operation | Premise | Attacks = co - operation helps to understand other ' s perspective and learn by their mistakes ] .

Target TANL: Unfortunately , the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction . [ An individual must compete with oneself only , instead of trying to beat others | Premise | Supports = Competition helps in improvement and evolution ] . [ Competition has helped the development of science and technology | Premise | Supports = Competition helps in improvement and evolution ] . [ Competition helps in improvement and evolution | Claim ] . For example , [ every other day , new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others | Premise | Supports = Competition helps in improvement and evolution ] . [ This kind of competition gives customers more options | Premise | Supports = every other day , new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others ] .

Target TANL: However , [ blind and selfish competition is detrimental | Premise | Supports = Competition should be always based on self - improvement rule ] . [ ' Your loss , my gain ' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run | Premise | Supports = Competition should be always based on self - improvement rule ] . [ Competition should be always based on self - improvement rule | Claim ] . [ A healthy competition which involves raising one ' s own level above others is the best approach | Premise | Supports = Competition should be always based on self - improvement rule ] .

Target TANL: Thus , competition and co - operation go hand in hand . These are two sides of the same coin which can ' t be separated . I firmly believe that [ children should be taught co - operation complimented with a healthy competition | MajorClaim ] . They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition . When co - operation and healthy competition is followed together , success , achievements , recognition and any goal becomes easier .

Target TANL: Capital punishment - necessary or not Crime is always punishable . Retribution is the method for countering criminals . Some countries have stringent rules , like capital punishment , while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system . However , [ strict laws , like capital punishment , are essential in a society | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ Capital punishment is given only in the " rarest of the rare " cases | Premise | Supports = capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals ] . [ Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings | Premise | Supports = capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals ] . [ When a criminal becomes a threat to the society , such that they can commit heinous crimes , then they are given capital punishment | Premise | Supports = capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals ] . Thus , [ capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , [ capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes | Premise | Supports = the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased ] . [ When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment , they will fear and not commit such crimes | Premise | Supports = the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased ] . Thus , [ the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Importantly , [ capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals | Premise | Supports = Criminals who don ' t have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are , therefore , given capital punishment ] . [ Criminals who don ' t have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are , therefore , given capital punishment | Claim ] .

Target TANL: However , [ the jury giving the verdict are also humans | Premise | Supports = They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent , circumstantially marred criminals ] . [ They have the life of a person at their discretion | Premise | Supports = They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent , circumstantially marred criminals ] . [ They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent , circumstantially marred criminals | Claim ] . [ The jury must therefore , take into account the circumstances of committing a crime | Premise | Supports = They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent , circumstantially marred criminals ] . For example , [ if an individual murders someone for self - defense , then such a crime is not heinous | Premise | Supports = The jury must therefore , take into account the circumstances of committing a crime ] . [ Only deserving criminals , who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment | Premise | Supports = The jury must therefore , take into account the circumstances of committing a crime ] .

Target TANL: [ Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society | MajorClaim ] . I firmly believe that [ psychopaths , terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment | MajorClaim ] . [ Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner | Claim ] . However , it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict .

Target TANL: Should universities accept equal number of males / females or not Education is important for the development of the world . Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not . However , since both genders are equally important , both must be given equal opportunities . [ Universities must admit both in equal numbers , depending on their choices | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ Right to education is a basic human right of both , males and females | Premise | Supports = females should be given equal opportunities as males ] . [ The whole world aims for women empowerment | Premise | Supports = females should be given equal opportunities as males ] , and to achieve this , [ females should be given equal opportunities as males | Claim ] . [ When universities will accept them in equal number , both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop | Premise | Supports = females should be given equal opportunities as males ] .

Target TANL: [ Co - education helps both genders to gel well with each other | Premise | Supports = Universities giving both genders equal opportunities , will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run ] . [ It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together | Premise | Supports = Universities giving both genders equal opportunities , will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run ] . For example , [ students studying in boy ' s colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them | Premise | Supports = It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together ] . On the other hand , [ females studying in girl ' s colleges are too shy to face boys | Premise | Supports = It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together ] . [ Co - education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both | Premise | Supports = It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together ] . [ Universities giving both genders equal opportunities , will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Unfortunately , [ some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields , like maths , mechanical engineering , defense etc | Claim ] . [ This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society | Premise | Attacks = some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields , like maths , mechanical engineering , defense etc ] . Time and again , [ women have proved their mettle in every field | Premise | Supports = This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society ] . [ Women like Margaret Thatcher , Indira Gandhi , Mari Curie etc . , are symbols of women ' s intelligence and skills | Premise | Supports = This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society ] .

Target TANL: Thus , I firmly believe that [ both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers | MajorClaim ] . [ Equality in education will help in development of the society | Claim ] . [ Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior | Premise | Supports = Equality in education will help in development of the society ] . Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit , irrespective of the gender . Educational rights must be given to both genders .

Target TANL: People will spend less time on cooking food Perhaps , no issue in this world is as significant to people as cooking food , because it affects everybody in their daily lives . Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food . However , I do think that [ people are likely to spend less time in cooking food | MajorClaim ] . There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint , and among those reasons are two important ones .

Target TANL: The first and foremost reason is that [ with the development of science and technology , more advanced kitchen facilities , such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers , have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time | Premise | Supports = people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two , even three hours like in the last 10 years ] . As a result , [ people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two , even three hours like in the last 10 years | Premise | Supports = it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future ] . Actually , [ in recent years , there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework | Premise | Supports = it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future ] . [ And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology | Premise | Supports = it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future ] . Thus , [ it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Another reason is that [ most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants | Claim ] because [ they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves | Premise | Supports = most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants ] . According to a recent survey , [ 89 % of people have come to think that , since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures , they have to use a lot of time to work hard , to update themselves , to acquire all kinds of skills and so on | Premise | Supports = they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal ] . Thus , [ they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal | Premise | Supports = most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants ] . [ Even they have some spare time , they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study | Premise | Supports = most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants ] .

Target TANL: Some people may argue that [ investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family | Claim ] . To some extent , it is true . However , [ as a matter of fact , using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality | Premise | Supports = it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality , but do not waste a lot of time ] . [ Even , with the help of ozone machines , bacterias , mold spores , or pesticide in vegetables , fruits and foods will be killed and removed | Premise | Supports = health and life of eaters is assured ] , thus [ health and life of eaters is assured | Premise | Supports = it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality , but do not waste a lot of time ] . Besides , [ along with the high living standard , requirements of quality products in almost restaurants , nowadays , are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities | Premise | Supports = it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality , but do not waste a lot of time ] . Consequently , [ it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality , but do not waste a lot of time | Premise | Attacks = investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , if all those factors are contemplated , it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint . So , from what have been discussed above , I strongly affirm the conclusion that [ people will spend less time in cooking food | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Traditional games or modern games in developing children ' s skills Games have played a key role in children ' s growth , especially in terms of their abilities . With technological advances , children have more access to modern games currently . In such case , the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children ' s developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion . For me , I believe [ parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: It is true that [ modern games may be , to some extent , beneficial for children to foster some skills , such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend | Claim ] . This is because [ children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games , which , in fact , helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future | Premise | Supports = modern games may be , to some extent , beneficial for children to foster some skills , such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend ] . At the same time , [ children have the chance to experience the state - of - the - art technology , raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative | Premise | Supports = modern games may be , to some extent , beneficial for children to foster some skills , such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend ] .

Target TANL: However , I think [ traditional games are still indispensible in children ' s learning process , even much more essential than modern games , especially in modern society | Claim ] . [ One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children ' s communication skills | Premise | Supports = traditional games are still indispensible in children ' s learning process , even much more essential than modern games , especially in modern society ] . [ Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines , traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat , laugh and cooperate face to face | Premise | Supports = communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more ] . As a result , [ communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more | Premise | Supports = One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children ' s communication skills ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , [ it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today | Claim ] . In fact , [ these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children ' s skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices | Premise | Supports = it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today ] . By contrast , [ modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits | Premise | Supports = there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents , such as violence or pornography , arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival ] . Therefore , [ there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents , such as violence or pornography , arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival | Premise | Supports = it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today ] .

Target TANL: Thus , I would conclude that [ traditional games should be , by no means , ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games | MajorClaim ] . [ Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Government shouldn ' t put money on building theaters or sports stadiums How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public . Recently , some people argue that [ government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities | MajorClaim ] . As far as I am concerned , this proposal is beneficial more to the society .

Target TANL: [ Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums | Premise | Supports = providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government ] . As a matter of fact , [ an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals , whereas a physical damaged person , resulting from the lack of medical treatment , may no longer participate in any sports games | Premise | Supports = Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums ] . Therefore , [ providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ Entertaining facilities such as cinemas , theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit - oriented | Claim ] . [ Their existences are based on their marketing strategies , the condition of facilities and the volume of audience | Premise | Supports = Entertaining facilities such as cinemas , theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit - oriented ] . [ The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market , which should not be interfered by government | Premise | Supports = Entertaining facilities such as cinemas , theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit - oriented ] . Instead , [ the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits , which deserves more funds from government | Premise | Supports = Entertaining facilities such as cinemas , theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit - oriented ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , [ putting taxpayers ' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them | Premise | Supports = sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support ] . For example , [ not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot | Premise | Supports = it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens ' tax funds to meet a minority of people ' s needs ] . Therefore , [ it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens ' tax funds to meet a minority of people ' s needs | Premise | Supports = sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support ] . That is the reason why [ sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support | Claim ] , because [ they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis | Premise | Supports = sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support ] .

Target TANL: To summarize , I strongly agree that [ budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities | MajorClaim ] , because [ the former is more essential , non - profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Technology keeps traditional skills and ways of life alive or not ? Living in the 21st century , people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity . Thus , every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years , regardless of any potential problems it may bring about . Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles . However , I believe their concern is groundless . Instead , [ technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ In terms of time and space , technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life | Claim ] . [ In the past , only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles | Premise | Supports = In terms of time and space , technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life ] . [ This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills | Premise | Supports = In terms of time and space , technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life ] . However , [ with the access to the Internet , one of the greatest innovations in modern society , humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime , anywhere | Premise | Supports = In terms of time and space , technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life ] .

Target TANL: Additionally , [ technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage , making it more vivid and appealing | Claim ] . For example , [ China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo , using a variety of state - of - the - art technological methods , such as robots and LED screens | Premise | Supports = technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage , making it more vivid and appealing ] . In fact , [ many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture | Premise | Supports = technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage , making it more vivid and appealing ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles | Claim ] . They argue that people , [ especially youngsters , are crazier about fresh and advanced things , such as digital products , thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques | Premise | Supports = some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles ] . But I believe this is not the issue because [ people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years | Premise | Attacks = especially youngsters , are crazier about fresh and advanced things , such as digital products , thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques ] .

Target TANL: Therefore , I will conclude that [ technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles | MajorClaim ] . Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run .

Target TANL: Creative Artists Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life ; however , some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government . It is my personal belief that [ freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it ' s rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists ' will to create | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ One of the major concerns against freeing artists ' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society | Claim ] ; however , I believe [ the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work | Premise | Attacks = One of the major concerns against freeing artists ' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society ] . It is needless to say that [ art inevitably involves imagination , exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated ; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not , it is the public ' s authority to determine how to interpret its meaning | Premise | Attacks = One of the major concerns against freeing artists ' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society ] . [ If the art displays unreality , the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value | Premise | Attacks = One of the major concerns against freeing artists ' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society ] ; if the art reflects the reality , then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth ? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth ? In a word , [ the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified | Premise | Attacks = One of the major concerns against freeing artists ' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society ] .

Target TANL: Let ' s then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals . It is undeniable that [ some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity , violence , eroticism etc | Premise | Supports = restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply ] . I absolutely agree that [ restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply | Claim ] as [ adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents | Premise | Supports = restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply ] ; however , [ in the case of adults being the audience , there ' s really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain - washed only because of some pieces of creative art | Premise | Supports = restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply ] .

Target TANL: By way of conclusion , I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work ; on the contrary , [ they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas | MajorClaim ] – [ this world needs them to make itself colourful | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life , including the revolution of feminism . Women have been opened up to more chances than ever . [ This , contrary to some ideas , is a positive progress in human society | MajorClaim ] from my point of view .

Target TANL: To start with , [ the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society | Premise | Supports = Women nowadays are much more active , they may be successful businessmen , they join the political world , they become scientists and so on ] . [ Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children | Premise | Supports = Women nowadays are much more active , they may be successful businessmen , they join the political world , they become scientists and so on ] . [ Women nowadays are much more active , they may be successful businessmen , they join the political world , they become scientists and so on | Claim ] . This is to say , [ the " weaker " gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men , not to mention they even perform better in some fields | Premise | Supports = Women nowadays are much more active , they may be successful businessmen , they join the political world , they become scientists and so on ] .

Target TANL: In the second place , [ the revolution in females ' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well | Claim ] . [ The financial burden of families , for instance , has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money | Premise | Supports = the revolution in females ' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well ] . What is more , [ women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration | Premise | Supports = the revolution in females ' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well ] .

Target TANL: Admittedly , [ such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate | Claim ] or , under many circumstances , [ women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives | Premise | Supports = such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate ] . Also , [ children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work | Premise | Supports = such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate ] . Yet everything has it upside and downside , women should find the best way to overcome such challenges .

Target TANL: All things considered , [ in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Growing traffic and pollution can be controlled by increasing petrol prices As we read newspapers or watch TV , we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues , air and water pollution questions . Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems . As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far - reaching , [ it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems | MajorClaim ] , though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society .

Target TANL: Specifically , [ price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas , for example , in the farming products and in the real estate area | Premise | Attacks = it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly ] ; however , [ whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated | Premise | Attacks = price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas , for example , in the farming products and in the real estate area ] . On one hand , [ governments have a macro - economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands | Premise | Supports = it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly ] . Consequently , [ it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly | Claim ] . On the other hand , [ pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil , chemical pollutants , extra lights , also constitute considerable amount of pollution | Premise | Supports = it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly ] . In addition , [ the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed - up of working pace , resulting in traffic jams during rush - hours | Premise | Supports = it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly ] .

Target TANL: As illustrated before , [ several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems | Claim ] . Primarily , [ authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities , such as constructing more bus lines , in order to reducing the usage of private cars | Premise | Supports = several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems ] . Furthermore , [ temporarily targets should be set , with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time , for example , a season | Premise | Supports = several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems ] . Plus [ with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems | Premise | Supports = several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems ] . Meanwhile , [ cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out , though it might not be into effect immediately , but in the long run , it would be a wise choice | Premise | Supports = several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate | MajorClaim ] , while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable , plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised .

Target TANL: Is image more powerful than the written word ? " A picture is worth a thousand words " is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time . This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages , ideas , or opinions to people . Nevertheless , the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used . Hence , [ I agree only to certain degree that in today ' s world , image serves as a more effective means of communication | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ pictures can influence the way people think | Claim ] . For example , [ nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking | Premise | Supports = statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers , indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit ] . As a result , [ statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers , indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit | Premise | Supports = pictures can influence the way people think ] . Not only that , [ the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter , which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan | Premise | Supports = it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many ] . Apart from that , [ images are also widely used in newspapers , magazines and advertisements | Premise | Supports = it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many ] . Thus , [ it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Looking from another perspective , [ written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages | Claim ] . [ With only pictures , everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images | Premise | Supports = written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages ] . Nonetheless , [ this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about | Premise | Supports = written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages ] . Furthermore , [ the primary way of educating students is also by this way | Premise | Supports = written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages ] . [ Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better | Premise | Supports = written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages ] .

Target TANL: To conclude , [ both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect , either images or words | MajorClaim ] . Hence , for a more meaningful communication , these two elements have their respective roles to play : image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject .

Target TANL: Several languages are in danger of extinction It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world . Some people , therefore , harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them . But the others do not believe it is possible . In my opinion , this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue .

Target TANL: First and foremost , [ it is easy to realize that languages , especially oral language , are a quite major part of culture of a country | Premise | Supports = Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting ] . [ It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country | Premise | Supports = Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting ] . [ The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional , customs and habitants do not exist | Premise | Supports = Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting ] . [ Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting | Claim ] . What is more , [ it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more | Premise | Supports = Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages | Claim ] . Although [ governments invest money on doing that , it is hard to gain the good results | Premise | Supports = there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages ] . As evidence of this , [ there are a few people , particularly the youngsters , do not pay attention on collecting and studying those | Premise | Supports = there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages ] . [ These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular | Premise | Supports = there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages ] . In addition , [ the preservations need a long time to gather , restore all information as well as train in the educational centre | Premise | Supports = there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages ] . [ If they do not try their best , their protection can be halted and waste of money | Premise | Supports = there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages ] .

Target TANL: In a nutshell , I am convinced that [ all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible | MajorClaim ] . All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those .

Target TANL: Do arts and music improve the quality of life ? My view is that the [ government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ Art is not the key determination of quality of life , but education is | Claim ] . [ In order to make people better off , it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens | Premise | Supports = Art is not the key determination of quality of life , but education is ] . This is simply because [ knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people ' s lives for a well - rounded social system | Premise | Supports = In order to make people better off , it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens ] .

Target TANL: Admittedly , [ art , to some extent , serve a valuable function about enriching one ' s daily lives | Claim ] , for example , [ it could bring release one ' s heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work | Premise | Supports = art , to some extent , serve a valuable function about enriching one ' s daily lives ] . However , [ it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries , in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room | Premise | Attacks = art , to some extent , serve a valuable function about enriching one ' s daily lives ] . [ By comparison to these issues , the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all | Premise | Attacks = art , to some extent , serve a valuable function about enriching one ' s daily lives ] .

Target TANL: To conclude , [ art could play an active role in improving the quality of people ' s lives | Claim ] , but I think that [ governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs | MajorClaim ] because [ those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Government should be responsible for education and health care or not ? Despite the development of modern society , the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens . And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens ' health care and education .

Target TANL: Some people argue that [ it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens | Premise | Supports = the government should be accountable for citizens ' health care and education to keep society safe and stable ] . This is because [ citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment , which should be enabled by the government , the leader of the society | Premise | Supports = the government should be accountable for citizens ' health care and education to keep society safe and stable ] . [ If citizens had no access to health care and education , their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk | Premise | Supports = such people might fail to get cured in time , thus influencing their working efficiency , which would destabilize the production of the industry ] . As a result , [ such people might fail to get cured in time , thus influencing their working efficiency , which would destabilize the production of the industry | Premise | Supports = the government should be accountable for citizens ' health care and education to keep society safe and stable ] . Also , [ without sufficient guidance of teachers , these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes , posing a threat to other citizens ' security | Premise | Supports = the government should be accountable for citizens ' health care and education to keep society safe and stable ] . Therefore , [ the government should be accountable for citizens ' health care and education to keep society safe and stable | Claim ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , some people oppose the argument , saying [ it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society | Claim ] , since [ a great number of people , in fact , have had the capacity to pay for the both privately | Premise | Supports = it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society ] . Instead , [ the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members ' wellbeing , such as soaring crime rate , AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure , which are requiring financial resources from the government to address | Premise | Supports = it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society ] .

Target TANL: Personally , I think [ the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education , who are the group in real need for the authority ' s help | MajorClaim ] . At the same time , citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas . After all , the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens .

Target TANL: Economic development vs environment Currently , a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries . However , some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems . From my perspective , I think [ flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Admittedly , [ some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection , thus ruining the local environments | Premise | Supports = the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting ] . As [ these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources , advanced technologies and experience | Premise | Supports = they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards ] , [ they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards | Premise | Supports = the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting ] . Besides , [ people in the poverty - stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems | Premise | Supports = unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen , which can put a strain on the natural resources ] . As a result , [ unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen , which can put a strain on the natural resources | Premise | Supports = the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting ] . In this view , [ the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting | Claim ] .

Target TANL: However , I believe [ the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment | Claim ] . [ With people raising their awareness of the green economy , the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients , which means eco - friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today , triggering sales | Premise | Supports = the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment ] . For example , [ electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years | Premise | Supports = the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , [ taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies | Claim ] . [ If a firm is environmentally conscious , it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment , which can boost productivity | Premise | Supports = it may spur its economic development ] . Therefore , [ it may spur its economic development | Premise | Supports = taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies ] . On the other hand , [ without the requirement of environmental preservation , the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs , being a hurdle to the economic development | Premise | Supports = taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies ] .

Target TANL: Therefore , I would conclude that [ thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously | MajorClaim ] . On the other hand , I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources , technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas .

Target TANL: Government should spend money on ARTs , not only on public services As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years , they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government . As a result , some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts . However , from my perspective , I think [ arts are supposed to be included in the government ' s investment as well | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Admittedly , [ the government should give priority to public services and facilities | Premise | Supports = public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability ] . This is because [ the government plays the role of a leader among citizens , which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable | Premise | Supports = public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability ] . Simultaneously , [ public services such as education system or medical care can meet people ' s basic demand of survival , security and knowledge , thus making them feel comfortable , which can lower the crime rate | Premise | Supports = public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability ] . Therefore , [ public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability | Claim ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , I believe [ arts should by no means been disregarded by the government | Claim ] . Individually , [ arts can enrich people ' s cultural lives | Premise | Supports = arts should by no means been disregarded by the government ] . [ Currently , people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition | Premise | Supports = they require various entertainment such as music , movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure ] . Consequently , [ they require various entertainment such as music , movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure | Premise | Supports = arts should by no means been disregarded by the government ] . [ Without arts , people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems | Premise | Supports = arts should by no means been disregarded by the government ] .

Target TANL: From the point of the local community , [ funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development | Claim ] . [ Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts | Premise | Supports = funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development ] . This means [ preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage , which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry | Premise | Supports = funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development ] . In this view , [ arts serve cultural and economic purposes | Premise | Supports = funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development ] .

Target TANL: With those arguments in mind , I would conclude that [ public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure | MajorClaim ] . At the same time , [ the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Keeping animals in zoos Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized . Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important , whereas , others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong . Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn .

Target TANL: First , critics of zoology argue that [ keeping animals in captivity is wrong | Claim ] because [ animals should be considered non - human persons and they should have the right of having freedom | Premise | Supports = keeping animals in captivity is wrong ] . [ This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures | Premise | Supports = keeping animals in captivity is wrong ] . That is because , [ many zoos , especially the ones in developing countries , do not provide care and attention which their animals require | Premise | Supports = This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures ] . [ The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment | Premise | Supports = keeping animals in captivity is wrong ] . In addition , [ sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe | Premise | Supports = keeping animals in captivity is wrong ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , the advocators believe that [ zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology | Claim ] . [ Many people , especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals , cute baby - born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world | Premise | Supports = zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology ] . [ Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public | Premise | Supports = zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology ] . Also , [ zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life | Premise | Supports = zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced ] . This is due to the fact that , [ in zoos , animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters | Premise | Supports = zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life ] . Thus [ zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced | Premise | Supports = zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ both of the arguments have strong supports | Claim ] , but in my own view , [ more good come from zoos than bad | MajorClaim ] . However , it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention .

Target TANL: Artists ' freedom to express ideas Artists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do . Nevertheless , some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions . I however , agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that [ the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First and foremost , [ if there is control over artists ' ideas , they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run | Premise | Supports = without any limitations , there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists ] . It is undeniable that [ when they are given the opportunity to express themselves , most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies | Premise | Supports = without any limitations , there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists ] . For example , [ paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times | Premise | Supports = without any limitations , there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists ] . In short , [ without any limitations , there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , [ it is every human ' s right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation | Premise | Supports = human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely ] . [ Today , many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries | Premise | Supports = human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely ] . [ Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country | Premise | Supports = human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely ] . To illustrate this further , [ the famous movie ' 3 Idiots ' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn | Premise | Supports = human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely ] . Thus , [ human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Looking from another perspective , there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted . [ They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country | Premise | Supports = In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races , this might end up in some chaos among the society ] . To cite an example , [ Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace | Premise | Supports = In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races , this might end up in some chaos among the society ] . [ In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races , this might end up in some chaos among the society | Claim ] . Nonetheless , I believe that [ artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts | Premise | Supports = In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races , this might end up in some chaos among the society ] .

Target TANL: To conclude , it is now evident that [ there should not be any restrictions on artists ' work | MajorClaim ] . [ Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves | Premise | Supports = there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas ] as [ ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations | Premise | Supports = Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves ] . Hence , [ even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects | Premise | Attacks = there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas ] , I certainly believe that [ there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas | Claim ] and thus , I strongly believe [ there should be no restrictions on them | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle . As far as my opinion is concerned , [ I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power | MajorClaim ] . I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages .

Target TANL: First and foremost reason is that [ pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons | Claim ] . [ Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons | Premise | Supports = pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons ] . [ If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage | Premise | Supports = pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons ] .

Target TANL: Another reason to fortify my opinion is that [ even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity | Claim ] . For example [ recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area | Premise | Supports = even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity ] . [ This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable | Premise | Supports = even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity ] .

Target TANL: Last but not least , [ while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power | Premise | Supports = Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it ] . [ Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it | Claim ] . [ This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material | Premise | Supports = Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it ] .

Target TANL: To sum it up , from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that [ nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages | MajorClaim ] . Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes .

Target TANL: Giving mobile phones to the unemployed Today , the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many . Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet . They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money . Nevertheless , I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that [ giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: In a positive point of view , [ when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet , they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities | Premise | Supports = if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone , they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive ] . For example , [ they can surf the The Star Onlines ' work section to find a job that is suitable for them | Premise | Supports = if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone , they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive ] . [ With the help of the net , they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job | Premise | Supports = if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone , they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive ] . Not only that , [ the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with | Premise | Supports = if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone , they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive ] . In short , [ if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone , they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Nonetheless , looking from another perspective , [ supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers ' money | Premise | Supports = the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed ] . This is because [ the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country | Premise | Supports = the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed ] . To illustrate this further , [ the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living | Premise | Supports = the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed ] . To conclude , [ the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , [ when hand phones are provided for free , many would want to take advantage of this opportunity | Claim ] . [ It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone , they make themselves jobless | Premise | Supports = when hand phones are provided for free , many would want to take advantage of this opportunity ] . [ Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones | Premise | Supports = the public ' s money is spent worthlessly ] . In this context , [ the public ' s money is spent worthlessly | Premise | Supports = when hand phones are provided for free , many would want to take advantage of this opportunity ] . On top of that , [ till now , there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment | Claim ] .

Target TANL: To put it in a nutshell , the suggestion of [ providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment | MajorClaim ] . I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them . I strongly believe that the public money should be utilized for the benefit of the society and not just for some of them who are not willing to put in more effort to find them a proper work .

Target TANL: Use of CCTV cameras Today , close circuit television ( CCTV ) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances . They are used in schools , businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place . It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer , especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise . Nevertheless , some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored . Even so , I strongly believe that [ CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ by having CCTV cameras at workplace , crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down | Premise | Supports = CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized ] . This is because [ when a shop is attacked by thieves , the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced | Premise | Supports = CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized ] . To illustrate this further , [ in Malaysia , policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight | Premise | Supports = CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized ] . Not only that , [ as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance , they will less likely steal from the shops | Premise | Supports = CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized ] . Thus , it is clear that [ CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , [ at some offices , employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers | Premise | Supports = these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers ] . At times , [ face - to - face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger | Premise | Supports = the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation ] . Hence , [ the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation | Premise | Supports = these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers ] because [ the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded | Premise | Supports = the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation ] . In the event of an argument , [ the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken | Premise | Supports = these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers ] . In short , [ these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Looking from another perspective , the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy . [ Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras | Claim ] . However , [ one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences | Premise | Supports = Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras ] . Ergo , [ opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime | Premise | Supports = Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras ] .

Target TANL: To conclude , [ CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise | MajorClaim ] . [ This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers | Claim ] . Admittedly , [ privacies are lost with the use of these cameras | Premise | Attacks = This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers ] . Nonetheless , [ safety should be put first in order to be safe | Premise | Attacks = privacies are lost with the use of these cameras ] .

Target TANL: Some prefer to work for a company , some prefer to work for themselves There are many kinds of jobs in society . Some of them are done by companies that related to government , and some of them are done by privat companies . Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages , [ I would prefer to work for myself , and have my own business | MajorClaim ] . There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others .

Target TANL: In the first place , [ there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others | Claim ] . [ In your job you can be boss of yourself ; however , in the other jobs someone else are your boss | Premise | Supports = there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others ] . [ You always have to be responsible for your task , and it make a stressful situation that I never like it | Premise | Supports = there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others ] .

Target TANL: What is more , [ when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves , but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager | Claim ] . Unfortunately [ nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers , and from my point of view it is unfair | Premise | Supports = when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves , but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager ] .

Target TANL: Finally , [ there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others | Claim ] . [ When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want | Premise | Supports = there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others ] . [ Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease , sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation | Premise | Supports = there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others ] . [ For all of them we have to ask for a permission , and most of the time we are not allowed | Premise | Supports = there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others ] .

Target TANL: There is no doubt that [ working for the other have some advantages | Claim ] , too , but I imagine [ people that have their own business are more comfortable | MajorClaim ] . [ They have more opportunities , profits , and authorities | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Some people think that human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that . Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals . From my point of view although [ endangered animals are important | Claim ] , [ human needs should be considered more | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ day by day population is increasing | Premise | Supports = human needs for food is increasing as well ] , so [ human needs for food is increasing as well | Premise | Supports = farmlands are vital for human life ] . [ We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn , and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks | Premise | Supports = farmlands are vital for human life ] . Therefore , [ farmlands are vital for human life | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals | Premise | Supports = they need land to build their houses on it ] , so [ they need land to build their houses on it | Claim ] . [ Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable | Premise | Supports = they need land to build their houses on it ] .

Target TANL: Finally , [ human need some crucial things to continue their life , and most of them are industrial such as medicine | Premise | Supports = some lands should be assigned to industry ] . Therefore , [ some lands should be assigned to industry | Claim ] . [ Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry | Premise | Supports = some lands should be assigned to industry ] .

Target TANL: To conclude , [ the population of endangered animals are less than people ' s population | Premise | Supports = they do not need so much land that people need ] , so [ they do not need so much land that people need | Claim ] . I would maintain that [ nowadays humans need farmland , housing and industry | MajorClaim ] because of [ increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Best way to judge about people is to be familiar with their personality - not with their look Individuals have two features , one of them is appearance and the other one is personality . From my point of view [ although appearance is important | Claim ] , [ personality is the most important | MajorClaim ] . [ We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance | Claim ] . Some people believes , individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person . I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes .

Target TANL: First of all , [ there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing | Premise | Supports = we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance ] , therefore [ we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance | Claim ] . For example , [ some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken ; however , after getting marriage they show their real personality | Premise | Supports = we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance ] .

Target TANL: Second of all , [ there are some people who are black skin , fat and frown , nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague | Claim ] . For instance , [ I have a neighbor who are old , black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her | Premise | Supports = there are some people who are black skin , fat and frown , nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague ] . [ One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys , so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home | Premise | Supports = there are some people who are black skin , fat and frown , nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague ] . [ She asked me to stay with her till my parents come , also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable | Premise | Supports = there are some people who are black skin , fat and frown , nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague ] . After that I understood , [ I had to never judge with people ' s appearance | Premise | Supports = there are some people who are black skin , fat and frown , nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague ] .

Target TANL: All in all , [ the best way to judge about individuals ' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance | MajorClaim ] . Unfortunately , many people play role to cheat the others , and they try to hide their real personality with their appearance .

Target TANL: Should wealthy nations support poor ones ?

[ The potential market in those poor countries , most of which has a huge population , is also a thing worth mentioning | Premise | Supports = such aid could also create a win - win situation ] . [ By building a good relationship with them , wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market , but also facilitate future international commerce | Premise | Supports = The potential market in those poor countries , most of which has a huge population , is also a thing worth mentioning ] .

Target TANL: Prevention is better than cure [ It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment | MajorClaim ] . Once applied , it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments .

Target TANL: [ Health education causes long - term positive effects on our next generations | Claim ] . First of all , [ thank to a full health education from their childhoods , children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences | Premise | Supports = Health education causes long - term positive effects on our next generations ] .

[ When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country , the community ' s health state will be improved remarkably | Premise | Supports = Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens ] .

Target TANL: The popularity of news media Nowadays news media have become more and more popular . Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits . However , it is possible that this idea is not completely true . It is widely seen that [ news media not only brings people entertainment , but also polishes up people ' knowledge | MajorClaim ] . Therefore , it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development .

Target TANL: First and foremost , [ today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before | Premise | Supports = the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings ] . [ The fact is that such news media as televisions , radios , or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody | Premise | Supports = today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before ] .

Target TANL: Jury must have access to criminals ' past records It is a well known fact that a jury involved in a case has no information regarding the criminal ' s past illegal acts under the British and Australian laws . There are few of those who are concerned think the current practice should be altered and that [ the juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion | MajorClaim ] . I , for one , agree to this resolution whole - heartedly as it poses advantages to various parties as I shall discuss below .

Target TANL: First and foremost , I believe that [ it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal | Claim ] . This is because , [ knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment | Premise | Supports = it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal ] . For instance , [ take a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty | Premise | Supports = knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment ] . [ The juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person | Premise | Supports = knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment ] . Then , [ punishment can be given in accordance to the condition | Premise | Supports = it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal ] .

Target TANL: Apart from that , [ a fair trial can be achieved | Premise | Supports = the convicted will also receive a fair action ] . As all of us know , [ juries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law | Premise | Supports = exposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision ] . Thus , [ exposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision | Premise | Supports = the convicted will also receive a fair action ] . By doing so , [ the juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences | Premise | Supports = the convicted will also receive a fair action ] . Not only that , [ the convicted will also receive a fair action | Claim ] .

Target TANL: It is undeniable that [ when the background of the convicted is ' dug ' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people , his privacy is being jeopardized | Claim ] . [ If finally he is proven innocent , he may feel embarrassed to face the public | Premise | Supports = when the background of the convicted is ' dug ' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people , his privacy is being jeopardized ] . However , I am sure that [ the crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well | Premise | Attacks = when the background of the convicted is ' dug ' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people , his privacy is being jeopardized ] .

Target TANL: To conclude , I definitely feel that [ the current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with | MajorClaim ] . This is of paramount importance so that [ they will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted | Claim ] . Beneficial changes will certainly take place if changes are made because for a change to happen , changes have to be done .

Target TANL: Taking a break before starting higher education is a good idea Nowadays , it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies . It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students . Students take a break of year or two , some students travel all around the world during this time , and some choose to take up a job .

Target TANL: [ Experience gained through traveling to different places , meeting different people and even at job goes long way | Claim ] . [ It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent | Premise | Supports = Experience gained through traveling to different places , meeting different people and even at job goes long way ] . [ Student ' s who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies | Premise | Supports = Experience gained through traveling to different places , meeting different people and even at job goes long way ] .

[ This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs , one needs a proper and higher qualification | Premise | Supports = Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts ] .

Target TANL: In my view point , [ I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education | MajorClaim ] . [ Students who take break , gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working | Claim ] . [ They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature | Premise | Supports = Students who take break , gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working ] .

Target TANL: University education is needed for success In today ' s modern and competitive society , it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life . Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions . I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree .

Interestingly , [ for some of them it proved to be a profitable job | Premise | Supports = there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university ] . To cite an example , [ Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19 | Premise | Supports = there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university ] .

[ The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph | Premise | Supports = individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful ] . To illustrate this further , [ David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many | Premise | Supports = The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph ] . Hence , it is evident that [ individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful | Claim ] .

Target TANL: To wrap it all up , [ it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person ' s life in order for one to prosper | Claim ] . However , [ it would be wrong to say that one ' s success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions | MajorClaim ] . Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress .

Target TANL: Should people be forced to stop working ? The appropriate age at which a person should stop working is now a much debated issue in the society . Some opine that people should be given the option to choose when they want to call it a day while others oppose this notion . In my personal point of view , [ the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old | MajorClaim ] . I , for one , [ strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age | MajorClaim ] due to several reasons that I shall discuss below .

Target TANL: First and foremost , [ if senior workers dominate the working sector , there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates | Premise | Supports = most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for ] . As a result , [ most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for | Claim ] . To illustrate this further , [ a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day , he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available | Premise | Supports = most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for ] . On top of that , [ due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option , there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace | Premise | Supports = most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for ] .

Target TANL: Apart from that , [ not all elderly workers are physically well | Premise | Supports = it would indeed be better if at an older age , opportunities are given to the younger ones ] . [ Beyond that age , a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses | Premise | Supports = it would indeed be better if at an older age , opportunities are given to the younger ones ] . To cite an example , [ the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him | Premise | Supports = they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing ] . Consequently , [ they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing | Premise | Supports = it would indeed be better if at an older age , opportunities are given to the younger ones ] . Besides , [ the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills , resulting in more loss for the institution | Premise | Supports = it would indeed be better if at an older age , opportunities are given to the younger ones ] . Thus , [ it would indeed be better if at an older age , opportunities are given to the younger ones | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Admittedly , [ the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated | Claim ] . [ Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering , medicine , and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation | Premise | Supports = it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge ] . Hence , [ it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge | Premise | Supports = the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ it is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement | MajorClaim ] . There will come a certain time when the older generation should hand over the responsibility to the fresh comers who are certainly waiting to be given a choice to prove themselves . After all , retirement not only marks the end of an individual , but also gives him a chance to make up for what he has lost throughout his working life .

Target TANL: Are museums necessary ? I believe [ public museums and art galleries will still be necessary | MajorClaim ] , even though [ we can see the art works and historical objects online | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work | Claim ] because [ the Internet really brings them convenience | Premise | Supports = Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work ] . [ We can browse the art work from all over the world at home | Premise | Supports = Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work ] . However , [ people may not get a spiritual experience | Premise | Attacks = Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work ] since [ pictures online are only limited to a screen size | Premise | Supports = people may not get a spiritual experience ] . By contrast , [ the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling | Premise | Attacks = Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work ] . For example , [ only when we see the real mummy , can we experience mystique | Premise | Supports = the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling ] .

Target TANL: [ In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits , museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing | Claim ] . For example , [ at American Museum of Natural History , you can make a bone - by - bone reproduction of the museum ' s stegosaurus | Premise | Supports = In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits , museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing ] ; [ at Museum of Art in New York , you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music | Premise | Supports = In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits , museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing ] . [ While if you " visit " the museum online , you may not able to get this kind of experience | Premise | Supports = In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits , museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing ] .

Target TANL: [ Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes | Claim ] . For instance , [ you can ' t see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist | Premise | Supports = Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes ] . What ' s more , [ not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen | Premise | Supports = Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes ] . [ Some details might be dim | Premise | Supports = Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes ] since [ the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough | Premise | Supports = Some details might be dim ] . [ These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects | Premise | Supports = Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I believe [ we still need museums and art galleries | MajorClaim ] but [ computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Should the cost of medicines be reduced ? At present , a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases . It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths .

Target TANL: Admittedly , [ more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines | Premise | Supports = The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity ] . [ The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high - quality drugs | Premise | Supports = The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity ] . [ With advanced technology , the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines , which can cure a variety of serious illnesses | Premise | Supports = The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity ] . [ If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs , their health situations may be better | Premise | Supports = The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity ] . [ The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity | Claim ] .

Target TANL: However , [ the current cost of medicines is , in fact , reasonable and based on the medicines ' effectiveness | Claim ] . Apparently , [ the process of researching , testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money | Premise | Supports = the current cost of medicines is , in fact , reasonable and based on the medicines ' effectiveness ] . Moreover , [ these products prove to ensure human health completely | Premise | Supports = the measure cannot be adopted , otherwise those companies will go into liquidation ] . [ Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs , they would make no profit , even running up debt because of production expenditure | Premise | Supports = the measure cannot be adopted , otherwise those companies will go into liquidation ] . Therefore , [ the measure cannot be adopted , otherwise those companies will go into liquidation | Claim ] . In short , this is not a long - term solution .

Target TANL: Fortunately , [ there are other measures to improve the situation | Claim ] . [ It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes | Premise | Supports = there are other measures to improve the situation ] . Additionally , [ charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free | Premise | Supports = there are other measures to improve the situation ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines , which may exacerbate their qualities | MajorClaim ] . Instead , the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price .

Target TANL: Prohibit public smoking ? The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors . As a result , some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area . It is agreed that [ the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time | Premise | Supports = the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented ] . [ Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking | Premise | Supports = the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented ] . [ A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases | Premise | Supports = the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented ] . Therefore , [ the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender | Claim ] . For instance , [ the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés , hospital and shopping street | Premise | Supports = the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender ] . [ This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result , Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness | Premise | Supports = the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender ] . [ This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole | Premise | Supports = the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , [ the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation | MajorClaim ] . It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country .

Target TANL: Amount of control on media information Nowadays , one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers , televisions and websites . It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public . However , I strongly believe that [ it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content | Claim ] . [ They have a serious impact on people in their puberty | Premise | Supports = One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content ] . For example , [ an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal , where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off | Premise | Supports = They have a serious impact on people in their puberty ] . Another supporting reason is that [ television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture | Claim ] . [ A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser | Premise | Supports = television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture ] . [ This is actually very environmentally unfriendly | Premise | Supports = television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture ] .

Target TANL: The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens . In other words , [ the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner , especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases | Claim ] . [ Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example , the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths | Premise | Supports = the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner , especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases ] . Even so , [ another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest | Premise | Attacks = the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner , especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases ] .

Target TANL: Both sides of the arguments have its merits . My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety , [ the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information | MajorClaim ] . Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea .

Target TANL: Citizen ' s only responsibility is to pay taxes There is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen . Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens , while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities .

Target TANL: [ Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries | Premise | Supports = they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen ] . [ If people are paying taxes , that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country ' s economy | Premise | Supports = they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen ] . Therefore , [ they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Some people argue that [ individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax | Claim ] . In fact , [ in order to develop a country , citizens must obey laws , which were imposed by the government | Premise | Supports = individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax ] . In this way , [ the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place , so the country will develop at a rapid pace | Premise | Supports = in order to develop a country , citizens must obey laws , which were imposed by the government ] . Furthermore , [ being a citizen in society should protect the country ' s culture and history | Premise | Supports = individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax ] . For instance , [ people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books | Premise | Supports = being a citizen in society should protect the country ' s culture and history ] . On the other hand , [ a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation | Premise | Supports = individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax ] . Indeed , [ if people in society have a strong bond with each other , society will become a peaceful place , where people are helping and sharing to each other | Premise | Supports = a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation ] .

Target TANL: Taking everything into account , I strongly believe that [ being a citizen involves in a number of duties , other than paying taxes | MajorClaim ] . [ People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Testing on animals and keeping them in unnatural conditions Perhaps the most serious problem facing the animals ' rights today is animal experimentation . Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing , including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health , I believe that [ primates should have the same rights as human beings | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned | Claim ] . Firstly , [ the costs outweigh the benefits | Premise | Supports = There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned ] . [ Every year , cosmetic companies , farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products , without any beneficial result | Premise | Supports = There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned ] . [ Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money | Premise | Supports = There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned ] , since [ they must be fed , cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances | Premise | Supports = Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ animals are kept in unnatural conditions | Premise | Supports = sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity ] . [ Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly , which influences their reactions to drugs | Premise | Supports = sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity ] . [ In March 2003 , a lab technician shot a video inside a lab , which revealed primates in cages without pain medication , for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head | Premise | Supports = sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity ] . Consequently , I think that [ sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity | Claim ] .

Target TANL: There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals . Many people agree that [ it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals , but also misleading | Premise | Supports = human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual ] , since [ animals and people ' s response to a drug can be different | Premise | Supports = it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals , but also misleading ] . I personally believe that [ human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual | Claim ] .

Target TANL: For the reasons mentioned above , [ it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result | Claim ] and consequently , [ it should be made illegal | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: " Pen and Paper " Examination Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world . At virtually every stage of the learning process , exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage . However , many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered .

Target TANL: [ There are clearly advantages to exams | Claim ] . [ They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates | Premise | Supports = There are clearly advantages to exams ] . [ They are also relatively versatile ; different types of exam questions , for example , multiple - choice questions and essay tasks , can test different sorts of reasoning ability | Premise | Supports = There are clearly advantages to exams ] . However , [ exams also have some drawbacks | Claim ] . [ Test - wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills | Premise | Supports = exams also have some drawbacks ] . In contrast , [ some test - takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety | Premise | Supports = teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested , thus narrowing the educational experience for all ] . In this case , [ teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested , thus narrowing the educational experience for all | Premise | Supports = exams also have some drawbacks ] .

Target TANL: [ A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns | Claim ] . Wherever possible , [ exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment | Premise | Supports = A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns ] . [ Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills | Premise | Supports = A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns ] . [ Other types of assessment should also be considered , assignment writing , for example , to assess independent learning and research skills , or group projects , to measure teamwork ability | Premise | Supports = A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , it is convincing that [ exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement | MajorClaim ] . However , [ exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Richer nations should help poorer nations in health , education and trade Improvements in health , education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations . [ Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ in the area of health , poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations | Premise | Supports = richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals ] . [ High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident | Premise | Supports = richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals ] . On top of that , [ poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients | Premise | Supports = richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals ] . To solve these issues , [ richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ in the area of education , it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions | Premise | Supports = richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries ] . Besides that , [ education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it | Premise | Supports = for the issue of education fee , richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students ] . In order to solve the education manpower problem , [ richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries | Claim ] . Meanwhile , [ for the issue of education fee , richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Lastly , [ in the area of trade , no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money | Claim ] . [ Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure | Premise | Supports = in the area of trade , no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money ] . For example , [ residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production | Premise | Supports = in the area of trade , no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money ] . As a token of goodwill , [ richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading | Premise | Supports = in the area of trade , no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money ] . [ The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading | Premise | Supports = in the area of trade , no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health , education and trade | MajorClaim ] . [ Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland | Claim ] .

Target TANL: There will be soon no role for teachers in classrooms In recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process . However , [ I do not agree that this explosion in technology will ' innovate ' the education system , by replacing teachers with computers | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers . Firstly , [ computers need to be operated by people | Claim ] . [ No one can argue that technological tools are must - haves for the classroom of today | Premise | Supports = computers need to be operated by people ] . For example , [ lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector | Premise | Supports = computers need to be operated by people ] . However , [ scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching | Premise | Supports = computers need to be operated by people ] . I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers , but [ they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human ' s touch | Premise | Supports = computers need to be operated by people ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ children need human interactions | Claim ] . [ No matter how advanced technology will be , it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils | Premise | Supports = children need human interactions ] . [ As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the ' Teachers Global Group ' - reveals , human interactions will never be imitated by computers : ' This verbal and non - verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper educatio | Premise | Supports = children need human interactions ]n . [ Without someone who can explain and understand their problems , pupils cannot actually learn ' | Premise | Supports = children need human interactions ] . I am inclined to agree with this scientific view , because [ only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils , be a friend and a model | Premise | Supports = children need human interactions ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ there can be no school without a teacher | MajorClaim ] . I think that [ computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process , but they will never take their place | MajorClaim ] . [ Teachers are not just teachers , they are also friends and conseilieurs | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Advanced fertilizers and machine for farmers , good or bad ? In recent years , the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy . While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products , others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people ' s health condition and the society .

Target TANL: Admittedly , [ applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers ' economic profit | Premise | Supports = the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased ] . This is because [ artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops , and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest | Premise | Supports = applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers ' economic profit ] . Consequently , [ the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased | Claim ] .

Target TANL: However , [ high - tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals ' health well - being | Claim ] . [ Unlike the organic plant foods , industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals , which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently | Premise | Supports = consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future ] . In this case , [ consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future | Premise | Supports = high - tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals ' health well - being ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , [ excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society | Claim ] . [ One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission | Premise | Supports = excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society ] . In contrast , [ manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages | Premise | Supports = excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society ] . For another , [ mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry | Premise | Supports = excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society ] , possibly because [ high - end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields | Premise | Supports = mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , even though [ newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers | Claim ] , it is convincing that [ the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Funding artists Nowadays , in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country , every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely . Therefore , there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists , but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space . In my view , I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons .

Target TANL: The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because [ art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists | Premise | Supports = the governments should help arts ] . For example , [ monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city ' s history and culture , but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists | Premise | Supports = art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists ] . In fact , [ some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue | Premise | Supports = the governments should help arts ] , thus , [ the governments should help arts | Claim ] because [ their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry | Premise | Supports = the governments should help arts ] .

Target TANL: In addition , [ sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation | Premise | Supports = culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art ] . Therefore , [ culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art | Claim ] . [ Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country ' s history and culture by observing various work crafts | Premise | Supports = culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art ] .

Target TANL: Another reason why artists should be helped is because [ talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted | Claim ] . Indeed , [ not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts | Premise | Supports = this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature ] . Hence , [ this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature | Premise | Supports = talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , [ art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere | Claim ] , so I think [ governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Whether athletes and singers are overpaid ? Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries , which can be up to millions of dollars each year . However , that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society . I believe that [ their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social , economic fields | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , some people claim that [ athletes and singers deserve their current salary | Claim ] because [ they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own | Premise | Supports = athletes and singers deserve their current salary ] . For example , [ hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship | Premise | Supports = athletes and singers deserve their current salary ] . [ They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training , let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves | Premise | Supports = athletes and singers deserve their current salary ] . In addition , although [ there are many singers and athletes , few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately | Premise | Supports = athletes and singers deserve their current salary ] . [ Overcoming all these obstacles , they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts | Premise | Supports = athletes and singers deserve their current salary ] .

Target TANL: However , their talents should not be overrated . Other people say that [ singers and athletes , in fact , contribute insignificantly to the development of the society | Premise | Attacks = their privilege of salary seems groundless , while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities ] . [ It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms | Premise | Supports = singers and athletes , in fact , contribute insignificantly to the development of the society ] . [ While scientists invent machines serving daily lives , doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation , singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life | Premise | Supports = their privilege of salary seems groundless , while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities ] . [ They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience | Premise | Supports = While scientists invent machines serving daily lives , doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation , singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life ] . Indeed , [ their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists , albeit necessary | Premise | Supports = their privilege of salary seems groundless , while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities ] . Hence , [ their privilege of salary seems groundless , while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities | Claim ] .

Target TANL: From all analysis suggested above , [ professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions | MajorClaim ] . I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields , namely science and society , who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation .

Target TANL: Capital punishment is necessary or not ? Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries . In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred , it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence . However , as the society grows , human rights become more highly respected , [ " murdering " criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , it is recognized that [ every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life | Claim ] . Although [ what criminals cause to the society , specifically to the victims , is indeed significantly offensive | Premise | Attacks = every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life ] , [ they are humans and their lives need to be valued | Premise | Attacks = what criminals cause to the society , specifically to the victims , is indeed significantly offensive ] . In addition , [ execution does not resolve the consequences of crime | Premise | Supports = every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life ] , not to mention [ it could put the criminal ' s family through hardship while the pain of the victim ' s kin is never to be consoled | Premise | Supports = every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes , life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives | Claim ] . Moreover , [ in terms of punishment , living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away | Premise | Supports = capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes , life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives ] .

Target TANL: [ The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted | Claim ] . [ Juries are also humans , they may lack of discretion | Premise | Supports = many people are executed for the crime they did not commit , which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system ] . Thus , [ many people are executed for the crime they did not commit , which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system | Premise | Supports = The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , although [ capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community | Claim ] , I firmly object to it because [ it is absurd and inhumane | MajorClaim ] . Furthermore , [ it can be replaced by a life sentence | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Businesses should be only concerned about making profits . There is no doubt that companies , factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people ' s need and make a profit for their managers . However , [ I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit | MajorClaim ] . [ With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want , they will threaten the beings ' life such as human , animals and plants | Claim ] . [ As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances | Premise | Supports = if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want , they will threaten the beings ' life such as human , animals and plants ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , [ if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit , they will produce products with low qualities and high prices | Premise | Supports = they might hit consumer ' s life ] , therefore [ they might hit consumer ' s life | Claim ] . For instance , [ a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk , sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die | Premise | Supports = they might hit consumer ' s life ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ all companies , factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive , and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit | MajorClaim ] . [ They can hit both the environment and human ' s life easily | Claim ] .

Target TANL: New high school Although some of my neighbors will oppose this idea , personally I approve it . [ The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community | MajorClaim ] . [ The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students , so they can ' t get enough education | Claim ] . I really believe that [ new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , I think that [ the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education | Claim ] . [ Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials , repairing of the place for sport activities | Premise | Supports = the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education ] . Also [ the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition | Premise | Supports = the students can ' t study well during the classes ] , so [ the students can ' t study well during the classes | Premise | Supports = the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education ] . [ They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school | Premise | Supports = the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city | Claim ] . [ After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school , participate in different competitions | Premise | Supports = the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city ] . For instance [ during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch | Premise | Supports = the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city ] . [ This will increase the social connections of the students | Premise | Supports = the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city ] . [ The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions | Premise | Attacks = the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city ] . [ The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed | Premise | Supports = The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions ] , but I think [ this isn ' t a important reason for ceasing the competitions | Premise | Attacks = The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , [ this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities , also the new educational equipment will increase the students ' enthusiasm toward studying | Claim ] . [ The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate | Claim ] , but I think that [ it isn ' t a big deal | Premise | Supports = The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate ] . So [ the new high school will be a great addition for my environment | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their olde It might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown , so they do not need any help for making important decisions . However , in my opinion , [ teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages | MajorClaim ] . I will discuss my view in two main areas .

Target TANL: In the first place , there is no doubt that [ parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children | Premise | Supports = they are the best advisor for their children ] , therefore [ they are the best advisor for their children | Claim ] . [ They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life | Premise | Supports = if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things ] , so [ if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things | Premise | Supports = they are the best advisor for their children ] . Also , [ they can save value things in their life such as time and money , and enjoy they life with the best way | Premise | Supports = they are the best advisor for their children ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , I have always believed that [ parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers | Claim ] , because [ unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money | Premise | Supports = parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers ] . [ They cheat young ages | Premise | Supports = parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers ] because [ they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily | Premise | Supports = They cheat young ages ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , it makes no difference , people from young ages to old ages are free to make a decision , nonetheless sometimes to prevent some problems coming up for young individuals , [ it is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Children are free You hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood . When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events . As much as their events might were bitter , in their adulthood they are sweet . In my opinion , [ childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: In the first place , [ children are free whatever they want to do , they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare | Premise | Supports = there is no argument and punishment for them ] . Because [ they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs | Premise | Supports = children are free whatever they want to do , they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare ] . Therefore [ there is no argument and punishment for them | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In addition , [ in this age they are not expected to be responsible | Claim ] . Also , [ they do not have to educate and they do not have to work | Premise | Supports = they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life ] , so [ they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life | Claim ] . As a matter of fact , [ I made a large number of friends in this age , and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten | Premise | Supports = they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life ] . Also [ I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age | Premise | Supports = they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life ] .

Target TANL: All in all , I would maintain that [ the best phase of people life is their childhood | MajorClaim ] . [ They not only free to do whatever they want without any confine or punishment , but also they are free and have a lot of time in their hands to try and experience new things and enjoy them | Claim ] .

Target TANL: People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology The life today is totally different from half centuries before . Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems ; however it also deprives of some things that we had . In my opinion , [ life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: The first reason is [ life is simple in the past | Premise | Supports = lives in the old days is easier than today ] . [ Nowadays , all humans compete together | Premise | Supports = lives in the old days is easier than today ] . Since [ world population getting higher | Premise | Supports = competition is getting fierce ] , [ competition is getting fierce | Premise | Supports = lives in the old days is easier than today ] . [ If you are not able to handle your jobs , then someone will replace you right away | Premise | Supports = lives in the old days is easier than today ] . [ People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition | Premise | Supports = lives in the old days is easier than today ] . Therefore , [ lives in the old days is easier than today | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ the environment today is serious damaged | Premise | Supports = the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today ] . [ Looking out the windows , what I see isn ' t sky , trees or mountains , but is coldly high buildings | Premise | Supports = the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today ] . [ Everyday , I walk on hard roads , breath in polluted air , and live in a limited space | Premise | Supports = the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today ] . What ' s worse , [ it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases | Premise | Supports = the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today ] . Thus , [ the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ The third reason is that the pace of life | Claim ] . [ Today , we are able to read the news all over the world , to chat with people through the Internet , or to travel around the world by planes | Premise | Attacks = The third reason is that the pace of life ] ; however , [ it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life | Premise | Attacks = Today , we are able to read the news all over the world , to chat with people through the Internet , or to travel around the world by planes ] . [ If we cannot react properly and immediately , then we will be in a vulnerable situation | Premise | Supports = The third reason is that the pace of life ] . [ We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace | Premise | Supports = The third reason is that the pace of life ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , while there [ some people live in a pretty good condition , it is only a minority | Claim ] . [ People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology | MajorClaim ] ; nevertheless , behind the glamorous facade of it , what we loss will never be returned .

Target TANL: Under suitable administration , tourism enhances local economic development Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy . Nevertheless , some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction , as a result of tourist activities , and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems . While both positions seem reasonable , my view is that , [ through proper management and regulation , a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region | Claim ] . [ This takes place , not only through direct expenditure from tourists , but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community , including retail , agriculture , and in the service industry | Premise | Supports = The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region ] . [ The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation , luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid , well - regulated tourism programs | Premise | Supports = The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region ] . Furthermore , [ tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community , including retail , hotels , transport , agriculture , and in the service industry | Premise | Supports = The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region ] . [ This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes | Premise | Supports = The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region ] . As a result , [ this gives energy to the economic cycle , generating local economic prosperity in return | Premise | Supports = The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region ] .

Target TANL: [ Some people may oppose these , citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism | Claim ] . In fact , [ compared to the tourism industry , other alternatives , like resource extraction and manufacture , are far worse destroyers | Premise | Attacks = Some people may oppose these , citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism ] . For instance , [ paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers , causing severe water pollution | Premise | Supports = compared to the tourism industry , other alternatives , like resource extraction and manufacture , are far worse destroyers ] . On the other hand , [ the dramatic majority of tourist , particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages , are well educated | Premise | Attacks = Some people may oppose these , citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism ] . [ It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so | Premise | Attacks = Some people may oppose these , citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism ] .

Target TANL: After careful consideration of both sides of the argument , [ the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages | MajorClaim ] . In conclusion , [ it is evident that under suitable administration , the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of arts The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate . While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services , I contend that [ this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , there is no doubt that [ governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way | Claim ] . Admittedly , [ no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health , education , transportation and communication | Premise | Supports = governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way ] . However , [ these could only help individuals with their physical requirements | Premise | Attacks = no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health , education , transportation and communication ] . [ There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts | Premise | Attacks = governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way ] .

Target TANL: On top of this , [ the arts play a pivotal role in all - round development of a society | Claim ] . [ No developed country could be named that music , painting , literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration | Premise | Supports = the arts play a pivotal role in all - round development of a society ] . [ Enriching people ' s life and enlightening their thoughts , the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways | Premise | Supports = the arts play a pivotal role in all - round development of a society ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , [ investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally | Claim ] . [ The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions | Premise | Supports = investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , [ not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind | Claim ] , but also [ it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: People are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification The career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century . People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living . However , a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security .

Target TANL: [ A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family | Premise | Supports = people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition ] . But [ with the recent recession , almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall | Premise | Supports = people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition ] . [ This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers | Premise | Supports = people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition ] . As a result , [ people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , [ the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment | Premise | Supports = many people ' s jobs are now at high stake ] . The official term of it is named " Technological Unemployment " . [ North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that , technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one | Premise | Supports = many people ' s jobs are now at high stake ] . For example , [ robots , automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks , interpreters , security services , retails and specially in manufacturing companies | Premise | Supports = many people ' s jobs are now at high stake ] . Thus [ many people ' s jobs are now at high stake | Premise | Supports = The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs ] . [ The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs | Claim ] . Last but not least , [ corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors | Premise | Supports = The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs ] .

Target TANL: For the reasons mentioned above , I believe that [ people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use Computer is a modern device that is useful for human life . People use computer particularly for work , study , even for communication . However , many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life . Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing , and they cannot do anything without that device . However , I strongly believe that [ computer can influence society , and people ' s lives have already been controlled by device | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: I would argue that [ this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people | Claim ] . [ A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to | Premise | Supports = the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected ] , due to the fact that [ they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working | Premise | Supports = A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to ] . As it can be seen from the example , [ the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected | Premise | Supports = this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people ] .

Target TANL: However , [ using computer can make people easier to complete their work | Claim ] . [ Businessmen , for example , use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues | Premise | Supports = using computer can make people easier to complete their work ] . [ Communication by feature - computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country | Premise | Supports = using computer can make people easier to complete their work ] . [ This is due to using computer more efficient and , many workers cannot do more in work without computer | Premise | Supports = Communication by feature - computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ in era technology like this age , computer becomes important thing in human life | MajorClaim ] . Every day , [ people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it | Claim ] . [ This situation becomes lifestyle habits , and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use | Premise | Supports = people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it ] .

Target TANL: Qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee ' s competency of their jobs With the increased educational level of workforce , there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process . However , some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion . The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion .

Target TANL: Firstly , some people suggest that [ qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer | Claim ] . [ It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job | Premise | Supports = qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer ] . Specifically , [ people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience | Premise | Supports = qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer ] . [ Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery | Premise | Supports = qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , it is no doubt that [ the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers | Claim ] . It is because [ people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently | Premise | Supports = the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers ] . [ Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other , especially when conflicts arise | Premise | Supports = the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers ] . [ Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way | Premise | Supports = the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers ] . Besides , [ organization have been transformed to customers oriented | Premise | Supports = Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction ] . [ Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction | Premise | Supports = the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers ] .

Target TANL: To my view , I incline to believe [ qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee ' s competency of their jobs | MajorClaim ] . Yet , [ the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others | Claim ] .

Target TANL: International aid The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters . Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people . However , it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located . My view is that [ international aid should be prioritised | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ International aid is critical | Claim ] because [ people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems | Premise | Supports = International aid is critical ] . [ Many people , for example in some African countries , are living below the basic standards | Premise | Supports = International aid is critical ] . [ They lack food , water or clothes which keep them warm , not to mention the education needs | Premise | Supports = International aid is critical ] . [ What is worse , people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security , homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members | Premise | Supports = International aid is critical ] . It is clear that [ those people are in desperate need of international support | Premise | Supports = International aid is critical ] .

Target TANL: Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders , [ it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens | Claim ] . After all , [ charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country | Premise | Supports = there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected ] thus [ there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected | Premise | Supports = it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens ] . Another reason is that , [ even within the most developed countries , there are still poor people who lack their basic needs | Premise | Supports = it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens ] . [ By solving the problems in the home country , it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth | Premise | Supports = it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Popular events are essential A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering . However , while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems , others think that they are just entertainment to distract people . I believe that [ they are important somehow , but not essential | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: As a matter of fact , [ world sport events provide positive waves for number of people | Claim ] . [ The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team | Premise | Supports = world sport events provide positive waves for number of people ] . [ These emotions are shared locally in our village or city , nationally in our own country but even internationally too | Premise | Supports = world sport events provide positive waves for number of people ] . Obviously [ these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased | Premise | Supports = world sport events provide positive waves for number of people ] . For example , [ the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun | Premise | Supports = these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , [ these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs | Claim ] . Thus , [ if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal , the reality is different | Premise | Supports = these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs ] . In other words , this is the " calm before the storm " . [ After the Olympics games are finished , everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority | Premise | Supports = these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs ] . To picture it , [ recently , Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries , but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn ' t listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea | Premise | Supports = these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs ] .

Target TANL: Finally , [ an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people , let them dream , being proud of their nationality and forget problems , but just for a while | Claim ] . [ These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Distance - learning cannot bring the benefits that traditional colleges offer With the tremendous development in information technology , long - distance education enables people to study at home without going to school . Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate . From my perspective , I agree with the view that [ students can acquire more benefits from the remote education | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense | Claim ] . [ Students who use distance - learning programs can cut down their commuting time , tuition fees , textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection | Premise | Supports = studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense ] . [ This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far - off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty - line | Premise | Supports = studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense ] .

Target TANL: Besides that , [ long - distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches | Claim ] . [ Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click , such as science reports , study posts , documentary records , etc | Premise | Supports = long - distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches ] . [ A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule | Premise | Supports = he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course ] so [ he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course | Premise | Supports = long - distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches ] .

Target TANL: It is undeniable that [ traditional education has its advantages in face - to - face communication , mental inspiration and physical educations | Claim ] . [ These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils ' personalities | Premise | Supports = traditional education has its advantages in face - to - face communication , mental inspiration and physical educations ] . But [ with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies , remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts | Premise | Attacks = traditional education has its advantages in face - to - face communication , mental inspiration and physical educations ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I concede that [ traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future | Claim ] . However , [ distance - learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency , convenience and economic value , but also with the self - regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Every student either male or female should be given equal opportunity In today ' s context , education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one ' s future . In my personal opinion , I am totally agreed with the view that [ there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses | MajorClaim ] . There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ judging student ' s skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular | Claim ] . Nowadays , [ both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education | Premise | Supports = judging student ' s skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular ] . [ In India , for example , female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations | Premise | Supports = judging student ' s skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , [ female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops , unlike previous generation females | Claim ] . In addition , [ due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting - edge technological developments , female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace , despite its intensive stress and pressure | Premise | Supports = female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops , unlike previous generation females ] . For example , [ Chanda Kochhar , who is the CEO of India ' s second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country ' s most powerful female head in business sector | Premise | Supports = female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops , unlike previous generation females ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I am firmly supporting the view , that [ every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects , provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender | MajorClaim ] . Government should take interim measures , to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit .

Target TANL: More convincing There is a hotly debated issue over whether face - to - face communication is better than other kinds of communication , and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . Some people tend to believe that communication in person is the best way of expression , while others seem to stand on the opposite position . After deeply pondering over this issue , I also develop my own perspective . I favor the former ; that is , [ I agree that face - to - face communication is better | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that [ communicating in person can be more convincing | Premise | Supports = we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way ] . [ Sometimes , face - to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully , and a fitting example can be found from my uncle | Premise | Supports = we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way ] . [ He once complained a service of a restaurant | Premise | Supports = we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way ] . [ Without exaggeration , he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal - - a fly concealed in it | Premise | Supports = we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way ] . [ Afterward , my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face - to face communication | Premise | Supports = we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way ] . [ If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone , I do not think this problem would be thought important | Premise | Supports = we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way ] . Therefore , [ we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Apart from the one I have mentioned above , another equally crucible aspect is that [ it is easy to be deceived without face - to face communication | Premise | Supports = we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face - to - face ] . For instance , [ I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend , Eric | Premise | Supports = we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face - to - face ] . [ He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore | Premise | Supports = we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face - to - face ] . [ I just shocked and did not know what happened | Premise | Supports = we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face - to - face ] . Finally , [ I realized that his facebook account was stolen | Premise | Supports = we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face - to - face ] . Hence , from this case , [ we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face - to - face | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some dissidents proclaiming that [ communication by letters , email , or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple , which is also one of the most important parts in communication | Claim ] . However , from my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying . [ It is conceivable that before we talk , it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words | Premise | Supports = communication by letters , email , or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple , which is also one of the most important parts in communication ] . [ Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication ; in contrast , it is usually detrimental to us | Premise | Attacks = communication by letters , email , or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple , which is also one of the most important parts in communication ] .

Target TANL: Based on the reasons demonstrated above , [ I prefer to express my opinion in person | MajorClaim ] because [ the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite | Claim ] . In other words , I think [ the best way of communication is by means of face - to - face | MajorClaim ] . It is not to say , of course , that other points of view are completely without merit . Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent .

Target TANL: Successful people do something new or take risks There is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things , and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . Some people tend to believe that to be successful , they should do something they are unfamiliar with , while others seem to stand on the opposite place . After deeply pondering over this issue , I develop my own perspective as well . I favor the latter ; that is , [ successful people still do things they already know | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that [ to be successful , we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter | Premise | Supports = successful people do not have to try new things or take risks ] . [ The lower the factors making us fail we have , the higher probability to success we own | Premise | Supports = successful people do not have to try new things or take risks ] . [ Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment | Premise | Supports = successful people do not have to try new things or take risks ] . [ He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest , and then just waits for the not so high but constant income | Premise | Supports = successful people do not have to try new things or take risks ] . [ He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time | Premise | Supports = successful people do not have to try new things or take risks ] . Therefore , we can commence to agree that [ successful people do not have to try new things or take risks | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , another equally crucial aspect is that [ it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not | Premise | Supports = it is not necessary for successful people to take risks ] . At least , [ a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success | Premise | Supports = it is not necessary for successful people to take risks ] . For instance , [ the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills | Premise | Supports = it is not necessary for successful people to take risks ] . [ The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm | Premise | Supports = it is not necessary for successful people to take risks ] . In contrast , [ those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed | Premise | Supports = it is not necessary for successful people to take risks ] . Hence , from this case , we are capable of stating that [ it is not necessary for successful people to take risks | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Admittedly , on the other hands , there might be some dissidents proclaiming that [ doing something new is necessary for people to success | Claim ] because [ they can become different from others , which is also a widely accepted idea for success | Premise | Supports = doing something new is necessary for people to success ] . However , according to my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence . [ Try something new can indeed make people become special | Premise | Supports = doing something new is necessary for people to success ] , [ while it does not mean successful | Premise | Attacks = Try something new can indeed make people become special ] .

Target TANL: Based on the reasons demonstrated above , I believe that [ doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed | MajorClaim ] because [ the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite | Claim ] . In other words , reducing risks and enhancing individual ' s capability is the most important path to success . It is not to say , of course , that other points of view are completely without merit . Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent .

Target TANL: University education should be only available for good students The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society , especially in high level such as college or university . Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level . However , in my opinion , [ it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good , knowledgeable learners | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First , [ focusing only on talented students is a better option | Claim ] because [ it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality | Premise | Supports = focusing only on talented students is a better option ] . [ Unlike middle school or high school , university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge | Premise | Supports = focusing only on talented students is a better option ] . In fact , [ some students may be capable in high schools , but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones | Premise | Supports = focusing only on talented students is a better option ] . [ That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people , and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions | Premise | Supports = focusing only on talented students is a better option ] , since [ they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone | Premise | Supports = That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people , and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ university should only accept good students | Claim ] because [ it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes | Premise | Supports = university should only accept good students ] . Some people argue that [ this may lead to ' social division ' , when someone with high education refuses to do the called ' low jobs ' | Premise | Attacks = university should only accept good students ] , but actually [ it gives no harm to the whole community | Premise | Attacks = this may lead to ' social division ' , when someone with high education refuses to do the called ' low jobs ' ] . [ Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone , while complex ones should be only handled by the best people , who start their career from the best institutions | Premise | Attacks = this may lead to ' social division ' , when someone with high education refuses to do the called ' low jobs ' ] . I think [ limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice | Premise | Supports = university should only accept good students ] since [ it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning , which makes them do the best to improve themselves | Premise | Supports = limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice ] . Ultimately , [ this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society | Premise | Supports = limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice ] .

Target TANL: To sum thing up , I agree that [ everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school , but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students | MajorClaim ] . [ This will improve the quality of both universities and students , thus placing people in positions which suit them most | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Improving facilities is the best way There is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers , and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities , while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students . After deeply pondering over this issue , I develop my own perspective as well . I favor the former ; that is , [ I prefer to spend money on improving facilities | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that [ the more advanced facilities we have , the more chances we can increase our knowledge | Premise | Supports = certain facilities are beneficial to students ] . For example , [ library is a good place for students to study or research | Premise | Supports = certain facilities are beneficial to students ] . [ They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience ; also , there are a lot of references for students to utilize | Premise | Supports = certain facilities are beneficial to students ] . [ With this convenient and versatile facility , students can improve their learning condition | Premise | Supports = certain facilities are beneficial to students ] . Therefore , we can commence to agree that [ certain facilities are beneficial to students | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , another equally crucial aspect is that [ students are not always staying in classrooms | Premise | Supports = students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities ] . [ They have numerous activities in school | Premise | Supports = students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities ] . [ Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school | Premise | Supports = students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities ] . [ He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance | Premise | Supports = students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities ] . [ With this distinguished performance , the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind | Premise | Supports = students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities ] . Hence , from this case , we are capable of stating that [ students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some people proclaiming that [ schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers | Claim ] because [ they can impart their students well | Premise | Supports = schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers ] . However , according to my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence . [ A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study | Premise | Attacks = schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers ] . [ It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards | Premise | Attacks = schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers ] .

Target TANL: Based on the reasons demonstrate above , I believe that [ improving facilities is the best way for school | MajorClaim ] because [ the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other | Claim ] . In other words , [ students can procure more advantages from better facilities | Claim ] . It is not to say , of course , that other points of view are completely without merit . Still , I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent .

Target TANL: High schools must be responsible for their future with well - planned curriculum Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to . They believe this motivates students to study . I think , however , [ students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics | MajorClaim ] . I believe that [ tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university | Claim ] . In addition , [ it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles | Claim ] .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested | Claim ] . [ They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects , otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject | Premise | Supports = students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested ] . For instance , [ a would - be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field | Premise | Supports = students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested ] .

Target TANL: Next , [ students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields | Premise | Supports = high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university ] . [ General education plays a significant role in specialized education | Premise | Supports = high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university ] . [ Science today , for example , is said to be more and more specialized , but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics | Premise | Supports = high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university ] . In addition , although [ textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects , in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects | Premise | Supports = high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university ] . For instance , [ you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry | Premise | Supports = textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects , in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects ] . Therefore , [ high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Last but not least , [ students have tendency to shun difficulties | Premise | Supports = schools should be responsible for their future and protect them ] . [ They might avoid tough courses , but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much | Premise | Supports = schools should be responsible for their future and protect them ] . [ This might result in limited choices in the future | Premise | Supports = schools should be responsible for their future and protect them ] . Therefore , [ schools should be responsible for their future and protect them | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In summary , [ students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education | MajorClaim ] . Besides , high school must be responsible for their future with well - planned curriculum .

Target TANL: The importance of games for adults comparing to children As people grow up , the arguments about the importance of games arise . Some people think that , adults need playing games as children do . However , in my opinion , [ games are no longer too important for them | MajorClaim ] for several reasons .

Target TANL: The first reason is that [ games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin | Claim ] . [ Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life | Premise | Attacks = games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin ] . But , [ more often , the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies | Premise | Supports = they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago ] , and as a result , [ they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago | Premise | Supports = games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin ] . For example , [ in my country , except for a minor part of professional athletes , the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job | Premise | Supports = games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin ] . [ They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives | Premise | Supports = games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin ] .

Target TANL: Another reason should be mentioned is that [ adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity , while children are always keen on competition and winning | Claim ] . [ For youngsters , maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not | Premise | Supports = adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity , while children are always keen on competition and winning ] . For example , [ my younger sister likes fencing , and thanks to her desire to win , she never gives up when facing a difficult situation , or even becoming hurt | Premise | Supports = For youngsters , maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not ] . On the other hand , [ adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately | Premise | Supports = adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity , while children are always keen on competition and winning ] . In fact , [ a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues | Premise | Supports = they no longer play games for any moderate achievements , and gradually lose their interest in such activities ] . Because of that , [ they no longer play games for any moderate achievements , and gradually lose their interest in such activities | Premise | Supports = adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity , while children are always keen on competition and winning ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , I think [ adults do need to play games , but their styles are often distinct from children ' s , which are often less competitive and more enjoyable | MajorClaim ] . [ Along with the high requirement for family and work , games are just some leisure activities for adults , not something necessary as they are meant to be for children | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Opinions regarding world culture There are many different opinions regarding world culture . Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture . However , in my view , [ a single modern culture is being created by modern technology | MajorClaim ] for the following reasons .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology | Claim ] . [ Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data , and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint | Premise | Supports = most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology ] . For example , [ students who are studying in Iran use the same software , Microsoft , to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students | Premise | Supports = most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world | Claim ] . [ Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries , and students are being encouraged to study in this field | Premise | Supports = new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world ] . For example , [ many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries | Premise | Supports = jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries ] . This example shows that [ jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries | Premise | Supports = new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world ] .

Target TANL: Some people might argue that [ there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture , and technology cannot affect them | Claim ] . This point has some merits on the surface ; however , [ many countries such as Canada , the USA , and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures | Premise | Attacks = there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture , and technology cannot affect them ] . In fact , [ cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet | Premise | Attacks = there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture , and technology cannot affect them ] . For example , [ two days ago , I went to a Canadian restaurant , and I ate noodle , sushi , which are Chinese foods , and Greek salad | Premise | Attacks = there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture , and technology cannot affect them ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , [ new technology has affected cultures of the world , and we can see many similarities in many cultures | MajorClaim ] . In fact , [ new technology has influences on educational system , jobs and foods in the world | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Reading fictions is more pleasant There are many different opinions regarding hobbies . Some people would rather watch TV . However , in my view , [ reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies | MajorClaim ] for the following reasons .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ fiction books pay more attention to details | Claim ] . In fact , [ we can know characters , places , and times of a novel very well during reading it | Premise | Supports = fiction books pay more attention to details ] . [ Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels , where each scene is happening | Premise | Supports = fiction books pay more attention to details ] . For example , [ after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution , I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people | Premise | Supports = fiction books pay more attention to details ] . However , [ a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters | Premise | Supports = fiction books pay more attention to details ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ reading a novel is more convenient | Claim ] . [ Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour | Premise | Supports = reading a novel is more convenient ] . [ Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains | Premise | Supports = reading a novel is more convenient ] . For example , [ I have started to read a novel since last week | Premise | Supports = reading a novel is more convenient ] . [ I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day , so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class | Premise | Supports = reading a novel is more convenient ] . In contrast , [ I cannot watch a complete movie | Premise | Supports = reading a novel is more convenient ] because [ I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that , I have to study | Premise | Supports = I cannot watch a complete movie ] .

Target TANL: Some people might argue that [ people enjoy watching TV | Claim ] when they know [ they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies | Premise | Supports = people enjoy watching TV ] . This point has some merits on the surface ; however , [ movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners | Premise | Attacks = people enjoy watching TV ] since [ characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners | Premise | Supports = movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners ] . [ For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable | Premise | Supports = movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , [ reading fictions is more pleasant | MajorClaim ] because [ these books have more depth , are much easier to use , and more useful for language learners | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Various local languages are becoming extinct Today , English is commonly used language across the world . Its usage is increasing day by day . As a consequence , various local languages are becoming extinct . Some people argue that , this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate . While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages . In my opinion , I believe [ using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way | Claim ] . [ Due to globalization , many people are traveling for professional trips | Premise | Supports = communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places ] . So , [ communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places | Premise | Supports = A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way ] . Furthermore , [ students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress | Premise | Supports = A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way ] as [ they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages ; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment | Premise | Supports = students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress ] . [ Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people | Premise | Supports = A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way ] . Adding to that , [ exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics , medical , astronomy etc would become easier | Premise | Supports = A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ few people are worried about the dying local languages | Claim ] . [ These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures | Premise | Supports = few people are worried about the dying local languages ] . [ They represent local culture | Premise | Supports = These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures ] . [ As the usage of these languages decrease , culture also changes accordingly | Premise | Supports = few people are worried about the dying local languages ] . Further , [ these languages are tightly coupled with history ; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost | Premise | Supports = few people are worried about the dying local languages ] .

Target TANL: To conclude , I believe [ change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one | MajorClaim ] . We have to accept these changes for a world to be a better place . [ Communication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Do you believe that elderly people used to live in a better world ? Changes are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in . Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing . I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons .

Target TANL: [ We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light , steering the world toward a much more convenient place | Claim ] . [ A clear - cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones | Premise | Supports = We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light , steering the world toward a much more convenient place ] . [ The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts | Premise | Supports = A clear - cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones ] . Moreover , [ some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face - to - face communication | Premise | Attacks = A clear - cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones ] . In my opinion though , [ social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch , the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago | Premise | Attacks = some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face - to - face communication ] .

Target TANL: [ The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and , thus , a happier place to live in | Premise | Supports = the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine ] . Today , [ even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists | Premise | Supports = the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine ] . [ The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives | Premise | Supports = the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine ] . To be specific , [ scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body , which is a miraculous breakthrough | Premise | Supports = the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine ] . In general , [ the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , even though [ the people from older generation may claim they had better life | Claim ] as [ there were stronger bonds between family members and friends | Premise | Supports = the people from older generation may claim they had better life ] , I think they are wrong , since [ they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice | Premise | Attacks = the people from older generation may claim they had better life ] . In light of the above - mentioned facts , one can easily conclude that [ in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Higher school students should be taught how to manage money There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before . Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate . Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money , while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal . In my view , I agree to that fact that [ higher school students should be made aware of the money management | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: The reason why I think [ teenage students need to understand the money management basics | Claim ] is , primarily [ when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation , students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family , during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence | Premise | Supports = teenage students need to understand the money management basics ] . For example , [ while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month , I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses , during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses | Premise | Supports = teenage students need to understand the money management basics ] .

Target TANL: In addition , [ if financial management is taught at an early age , students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status , students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized | Premise | Supports = having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently ] . For example , [ buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background | Premise | Supports = having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently ] . However , [ for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour | Premise | Supports = having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently ] . Hence , [ having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I think [ students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact | MajorClaim ] . However , the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense .

Target TANL: Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants Generally speaking , smoking is never been good for human ' s body . There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human ' s body . Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively , those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human ' s body . In my opinion , [ smoking should not be permitted , especially in public places like restaurants | MajorClaim ] because [ it will make the non - smokers breathe uncomfortably | Claim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals | Premise | Supports = Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals ] . [ Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals | Claim ] . [ They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them | Premise | Supports = Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ restaurants are places that people usually come with their families | Premise | Supports = Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children ] . This means , [ there will be children , grandparents , as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants | Premise | Supports = Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children ] .

Personally speaking , [ it is unfair for passive smokers | Claim ] because [ they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one | Premise | Supports = it is unfair for passive smokers ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ smoking should not be permitted in restaurants | MajorClaim ] because [ there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged | Claim ] . State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant ' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals .

Target TANL: Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way ? It ' s obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years . This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film . From my point of view , I believe that [ violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors , emotions & study | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: In the first place , [ children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best | Premise | Supports = unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors ] . [ Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs | Premise | Supports = unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors ] . [ Imagine an actor who is a child’s favorite is doing violent roles | Premise | Supports = unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors ] . [ In this case , the child would imitate the actor ' s behaviors in order to look like to him | Premise | Supports = unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors ] . Thus , [ unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Meanwhile , [ human beings are very sensitive , especially of youngsters | Premise | Supports = if these scenes are in TV , they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child ] . For instance , [ dying is always a disappointing happening | Premise | Supports = if these scenes are in TV , they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child ] . Furthermore , [ killing is worse | Premise | Supports = if these scenes are in TV , they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child ] . Therefore , [ if these scenes are in TV , they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Finally , beside all above mentioned items , [ the study of youngsters shall always been controlled | Premise | Supports = the study of a youngster would affected terribly ] . For example , [ a child watches a frightening movie | Premise | Supports = the study of a youngster would affected terribly ] . On the other hand , [ he has to study for the exam | Premise | Supports = the study of a youngster would affected terribly ] . In this condition , because [ he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it | Premise | Supports = it is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly ] , [ it is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly | Premise | Supports = the study of a youngster would affected terribly ] . Hence , [ the study of a youngster would affected terribly | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I certainly can say that [ growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study , emotions and behaviors | MajorClaim ] . Therefore , I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors .

Target TANL: Gossip - based information Nowadays information plays an important role in our world . It has become a product , which can be sold , bought , or stolen . Some people say : " [ information is power | MajorClaim ] " . That ' s why it is so important to be well - informed . I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons .

Target TANL: The first reason is that [ by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability | Claim ] . [ Some people may disinform you on purpose , that ' s why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information | Premise | Supports = by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability ] . For example , [ Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia , however , european news announced that it was initiated by Russia | Premise | Supports = by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability ] . [ After a while the situation became clear , but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia | Premise | Supports = by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ it is very important to know facts about some events or problem , not only estimations | Premise | Supports = you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts ] , because [ it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate | Premise | Supports = it is very important to know facts about some events or problem , not only estimations ] . Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts , especially in the internet , that ' s why [ you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts | Claim ] . [ It is possible to make a wrong decision | Premise | Supports = you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts ] because [ you have just used someone ' s personal opinion as a source of information , but it was actually wrong | Premise | Supports = you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts ] . For example , [ several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week , because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops | Premise | Supports = you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts ] . [ The gossip - based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the " salt - panic " was over | Premise | Supports = you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts ] .

Target TANL: To conclude , I want to say that [ it is very important to be confident of the information , which you use , especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Old buildings should be preserved The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture . In my opinion , [ all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings . [ As a result of the rapid urbanization process , in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities , the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing | Premise | Supports = governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings ] . Because of that need , [ governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings | Claim ] . Besides that , [ the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values | Premise | Supports = governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings ] .

Target TANL: [ Old buildings are an essential part of history | Premise | Supports = managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation ] . [ Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings | Premise | Supports = managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation ] . Therefore , [ managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation | Claim ] . Furthermore , [ the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them | Premise | Supports = Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there ] . [ Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there | Claim ] . . [ Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty , and that preservation help to finish half of work | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Overall , both of those view have strong arguments : the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism . So I think [ we should restore those building | MajorClaim ] because [ old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Popularity of mobile phones to young people Nowadays , many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends . Despite all these positive aspects , I think that [ the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones | Claim ] . [ Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time , leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities | Premise | Supports = many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones ] . Similarly , [ internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works | Premise | Supports = many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones ] . [ In my college days , I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone | Premise | Supports = internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works ] . [ I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show - off to my friends | Premise | Supports = internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works ] . [ That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester | Premise | Supports = internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic | Claim ] . [ They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand | Premise | Supports = juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic ] . Relatively , [ these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost | Premise | Supports = juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic ] . Furthermore , [ most of these juveniles are students | Premise | Supports = they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want ] so [ they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want | Premise | Supports = juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic ] . [ An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days , wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents | Premise | Supports = juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic ] .

Target TANL: This clearly shows that [ the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person’s education and character | MajorClaim ] . Therefore , I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones .

Target TANL: Cheap air travel should be encouraged ? In recent years , many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights . People have various different views about cheap air travel . Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged , I personally think that [ cheap flight can make many serious problem | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: It is undeniable that [ cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people , particularly for the lower income group | Claim ] . [ These days , millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure | Premise | Supports = cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people , particularly for the lower income group ] .

Apparently , [ more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it | Premise | Supports = growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment ] .

[ Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up | Premise | Supports = growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment ] . In fact , [ while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories , nothing is being done to reins the airlines | Premise | Supports = growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I would argue that [ the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits | MajorClaim ] . However , it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive .

Target TANL: Attending university classes should be required or optional Attending university ' s classes is one of activities that students have to do . However , class is not the only source of knowledge . Students also learn from other sources such as experience , libraries and other people .

Accordingly , [ with sales promotion , it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy | Premise | Supports = it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center , and save our time on the other hand ] . In addition , [ the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes | Premise | Supports = it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center , and save our time on the other hand ] .

Target TANL: Fossil fuels will soon be replaced ? Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy , as far as I ' m concerned , these [ new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases , oil , and coal | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive | Claim ] . [ Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford | Premise | Supports = due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive ] . On the other hand , [ fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas | Premise | Supports = due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive ] . For example , [ it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy , say expensive solar batteries and wind farms | Premise | Supports = the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming ] .

Target TANL: Besides , although [ utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly | Premise | Attacks = these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think ] ; [ these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think | Claim ] . [ Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long - term environmental hazards | Premise | Supports = these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think ] . For example , [ the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams | Premise | Supports = Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long - term environmental hazards ] . [ This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds | Premise | Supports = Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long - term environmental hazards ] . More importantly , [ the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up ; leaving problems for the following generations | Premise | Supports = Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long - term environmental hazards ] . Thus [ renewable resources are not as reliable as we think | Premise | Supports = these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think ] .

Target TANL: Admittedly [ contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain , deduction of ozone layer and global warming | Claim ] ; [ these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions | Premise | Attacks = contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain , deduction of ozone layer and global warming ] . For example [ we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain | Premise | Attacks = contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain , deduction of ozone layer and global warming ] . [ These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high - tech of renewable energy | Premise | Attacks = contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain , deduction of ozone layer and global warming ] . [ With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable | Premise | Attacks = contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain , deduction of ozone layer and global warming ] .

Target TANL: Another reason , [ jobs can divert students from their studies | Claim ] . [ If students started earning in earlier age in their life , then they get attracted towards money | Premise | Supports = jobs can divert students from their studies ] . [ They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money | Premise | Supports = jobs can divert students from their studies ] . [ This would affect their studies , they loose their interest from studies | Premise | Supports = jobs can divert students from their studies ] . Moreover , [ they drop out their studies so as to earn more money | Premise | Supports = jobs can divert students from their studies ] .

Target TANL: In addition to this , [ the main drawback of teenagers job is that , they miss out the fun of their childhood time | Premise | Supports = they should take advantage of life as much possible they can ] .

Target TANL: Studying alone or in a group When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates , I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again . [ I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features , getting help from other students , improving my attitude for learning , managing my time in an effective way | MajorClaim ] .

In addition , [ such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group | Premise | Supports = When pupils make a group for studying , all member of group have the same chance to help each other ] .

Target TANL: [ Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group - studying | Claim ] . [ In a group of student , the best of those always encourages others to study harder | Premise | Supports = Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group - studying ] . Besides , [ pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group | Premise | Supports = Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group - studying ] .

Target TANL: Should animals be free or live in zoos ? Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals . Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention . In my opinion , [ we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals | Claim ] . Firstly , [ like we , human beings , animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts | Premise | Supports = Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals ] . Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas . [ When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with , they begin to loose those in - born instincts | Premise | Supports = when they are released or in the worst case , when they escape , they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate ] . Hence , [ when they are released or in the worst case , when they escape , they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate | Premise | Supports = Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals ] .

Target TANL: In addition to the previous point , [ various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care | Claim ] . For instance , I recall my first trip to a zoo , at age eight . [ I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated | Premise | Supports = various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care ] . [ I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo | Premise | Supports = various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care ] . [ They beat them up | Premise | Supports = various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care ] because [ they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals | Premise | Supports = They beat them up ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I strongly believe that [ we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible | MajorClaim ] . [ Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals | Claim ] . Moreover , [ many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Cheap air travel should be encouraged ? In recent years , many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights . People have various different views about cheap air travel . Although [ there are good arguments in favour of this trend | Claim ] should be encouraged , I personally think that [ cheap flight can make many serious problem | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: It is undeniable that [ cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people , particularly for the lower income group | Claim ] . [ These days , millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure | Premise | Supports = cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people , particularly for the lower income group ] . [ They can develop their careers , broad their knowledge , and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds | Premise | Supports = cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people , particularly for the lower income group ] . Moreover , [ travels also help to promote the tourist industry development , boost the economy and job markets of many countries | Claim ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment | Claim ] . Apparently , [ more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it | Premise | Supports = growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment ] . However , [ the biggest concern is the effect on global warming | Premise | Supports = growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment ] . [ Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up | Premise | Supports = the biggest concern is the effect on global warming ] . In fact , [ while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories , nothing is being done to reins the airlines | Premise | Supports = the biggest concern is the effect on global warming ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I would argue that [ the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits | MajorClaim ] . However , it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive . Instead , people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices .

Target TANL: Improve roads or public transports Many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation . In my opinion , [ governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system | MajorClaim ] because [ it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating | Claim ] .

Target TANL: First , [ the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation | Claim ] . [ Cars depend on gasoline , which is a non - renewable resource | Premise | Supports = the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up ] . Therefore , [ the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up | Premise | Supports = the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation ] . In the contrary , [ if the public transportation is efficiently used , the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower | Premise | Supports = the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation ] . And [ this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource , gasoline | Premise | Supports = the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems | Claim ] . Averagely , [ public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars | Premise | Supports = public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems ] . [ It means that by using public transports , the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads , which is always full of fumes | Premise | Supports = public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems ] .

Target TANL: Last but not least , [ using public transportation is much safer than private transportation | Premise | Supports = there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation , a healthy , safe and economical way of transporting ] . [ According to National Safety Council , riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care | Premise | Supports = there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation , a healthy , safe and economical way of transporting ] . Thus [ there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation , a healthy , safe and economical way of transporting | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In short , I can say for certain that [ spending money on improving public transportation is necessary | MajorClaim ] because [ it is the key to protect our world , creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Spending money on supporting art or protecting environment If I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment , I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below .

Target TANL: First , [ conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history | Claim ] . [ According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association , we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed , which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered | Premise | Supports = conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history ] . What ' s more , [ rising sea levels , caused by global warming , have reached a level that is threatening human ' s life in many countries | Premise | Supports = If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non - environmentally friendly cars , nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change , causing flooding , drought , and an increasing amount of damaging storms ] . [ If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non - environmentally friendly cars , nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change , causing flooding , drought , and an increasing amount of damaging storms | Premise | Supports = conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history ] . In short , [ the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn ' t take harsh measures now , we never will | Premise | Supports = conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , [ supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually | Claim ] . Nowadays , [ an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation | Premise | Supports = sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising ] ; therefore , [ sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising | Premise | Supports = supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually ] . [ Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment , then your company would be known as an environmentally - friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer - oriented society | Premise | Supports = sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising ] .

Target TANL: Finally , [ conservation leads us to a higher standard of living | Claim ] . I confess that [ art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings | Premise | Attacks = conservation leads us to a higher standard of living ] , but , [ with exhaust fumes and acid rain , we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs | Premise | Attacks = art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings ] . [ Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art | Premise | Supports = conservation leads us to a higher standard of living ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , although [ supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short - term interest | Claim ] , [ I still hold the environment protection for long - term interest | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Luck vs hard work There are many instances that luck has brought people things that they never could even imagine . However , [ I do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one ' s goals | Claim ] . Therefore I strongly agree with the argument that [ it is one ' s hard work that helps him reach his target | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First , [ if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments , you are taking a great risk | Claim ] . [ Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way | Premise | Supports = if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments , you are taking a great risk ] . [ If it doesn ' t work , it would be a great disappointment | Premise | Supports = if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments , you are taking a great risk ] . Instead [ if you strive hard to achieve what you want , then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal | Premise | Supports = all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work , not my luck ] . In my personal experience , [ all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work , not my luck | Claim ] . And [ I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals | Premise | Supports = all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work , not my luck ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , if you believe that hard work is the key to success , it would make you a visionary person . In other words , [ those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination | Claim ] . [ They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal | Premise | Supports = those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination ] . [ If you believe in luck , you would be clueless about where you are heading | Premise | Supports = those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination ] . For example , [ a friend of mine , who had severe financial constraints , had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery | Premise | Supports = those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination ] . [ He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery | Premise | Supports = those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination ] . However , [ up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened | Premise | Supports = those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination ] .

Target TANL: Thirdly , [ if you work hard , luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target | Claim ] . For example , [ my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion | Premise | Supports = if you work hard , luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target ] . [ He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion | Premise | Supports = if you work hard , luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target ] . [ He realized that having a master ' s degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors | Premise | Supports = if you work hard , luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target ] . Although [ he had many commitments at home and work , he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply | Premise | Supports = if you work hard , luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target ] . [ At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship | Premise | Supports = if you work hard , luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target ] since [ he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity | Premise | Supports = At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship ] .

Target TANL: Although [ it is good to be lucky | Premise | Attacks = depending on luck for everything is not good ] , [ depending on luck for everything is not good | Claim ] . Hence [ I strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Should students be required to attend classes ? The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes . This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide . Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic . An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students . However , to my mind [ students should be free not to attend classes | MajorClaim ] because [ it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , a liberal policy is very feasible . Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy . Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend . So an optional attendance saves time and money .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ some students might learn better at home on their own , for instance , by reading the textbook | Claim ] . [ This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic | Premise | Supports = some students might learn better at home on their own , for instance , by reading the textbook ] . [ By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching | Premise | Supports = they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently ] . Thus [ they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently | Premise | Supports = some students might learn better at home on their own , for instance , by reading the textbook ] .

Target TANL: In addition , [ being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life | Claim ] . [ Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning | Premise | Supports = being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life ] . [ With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency | Premise | Supports = being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life ] . [ Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects , the better they perform in academic areas | Premise | Supports = being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life ] .

Target TANL: Finally , psychology knows two types of motivation . There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset . And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people . [ Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well - being | Premise | Supports = By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves ] . However , [ in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims | Premise | Supports = By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves ] . [ By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves | Claim ] . [ These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time | Premise | Supports = By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves ] .

Target TANL: To conclude , [ it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students | MajorClaim ] . [ I hold this belief due to the improvement of students ' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Living in smal towns Place of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors . Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas , whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town . [ I would prefer to live in a small town | MajorClaim ] and [ I think a small town has some advantages , such as good weather , a healthy life and better facilities | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items | Premise | Supports = it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities ] . [ One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town | Premise | Supports = it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities ] . Also , [ in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic | Premise | Supports = it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities ] . [ Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness | Premise | Supports = it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities ] . Moreover , [ in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits | Premise | Supports = it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities ] . Regardless of some exceptions , [ it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ another advantage of small towns is living costs | Claim ] . [ Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then , in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities | Premise | Supports = another advantage of small towns is living costs ] . Therefore , [ in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes | Premise | Supports = another advantage of small towns is living costs ] , also [ because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services | Premise | Supports = another advantage of small towns is living costs ] . [ Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic | Premise | Supports = we can save time and money ] so that [ we can save time and money | Premise | Supports = another advantage of small towns is living costs ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ I prefer to live in a small town | MajorClaim ] and I think [ it has some advantages such as less stress , because of better weather conditions and also , better relationship within a town | Claim ] . [ In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities | Premise | Supports = on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities ] therefore [ on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities | Premise | Supports = it has some advantages such as less stress , because of better weather conditions and also , better relationship within a town ] . However it is an obvious fact that [ people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress | Premise | Supports = it has some advantages such as less stress , because of better weather conditions and also , better relationship within a town ] .

Target TANL: Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field In today ' s community , economy becomes the order of the day . Getting to know the theory in this area seems really important for our students . Then , the earlier we jump into this area , the more skillful we will be . Thus , in my point of view , although [ it will take some time on it | Claim ] , [ high school students should take a course on basic economics | MajorClaim ] . Let me explain it in detail .

Target TANL: For the primary concern , [ it can provide students a sense of direction in academy | Claim ] . [ Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field , let them to know what this subject mainly discuss | Premise | Supports = it can provide students a sense of direction in academy ] . [ That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation | Premise | Supports = it can provide students a sense of direction in academy ] . Finally , [ students may study harder for their economic dreams | Premise | Supports = it can provide students a sense of direction in academy ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ economy is always correlate with politics | Premise | Supports = students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid ] , [ students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status , which may open their vision toward the nation and don ' t get limited in the textbooks | Premise | Supports = economy is always correlate with politics ] . Besides , [ there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises | Premise | Supports = students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid ] , [ students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In addition , [ the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college | Claim ] . [ They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time , with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students | Premise | Supports = the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college ] . [ That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible | Premise | Supports = the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college ] .

Target TANL: Considering all those factors above , [ I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: University education restriction Universtiy is an entrance to life . It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed . It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people . Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage | Claim ] . To be precise , [ such abstract or complicated informatin , easily absorbed by those students , may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills | Premise | Supports = outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage ] . Besides , [ it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done | Premise | Supports = outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage ] . [ University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain | Premise | Supports = outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage ] .

Target TANL: However , [ university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills | Premise | Supports = it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people , who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively ] . Therefore , [ it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people , who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively | Claim ] .

Target TANL: What is more , [ there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people | Claim ] . [ Apart from the disheartened ones , many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs , mostly the white - collar ones | Premise | Supports = there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , university restriction has both pros and cons . In my opinion , [ it will yield more negative results than positive ones | MajorClaim ] . That ' s why [ it should be made available for a wide range of learners | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues In today ' s world , the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens . I completely agree with the idea that [ governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: The first reason why [ education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system | Premise | Supports = society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients ] . I believe that [ decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients | Premise | Supports = society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients ] . Therefore , [ society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients | Claim ] .

Target TANL: The second reason why [ governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society | Claim ] . In my opinion , [ there is nothing more important than health in a human ' s life and the happiness and welfare come with health | Premise | Supports = governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society ] . Therefore , [ a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives | Premise | Supports = governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society ] . For example , [ the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well - being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign | Premise | Supports = governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well - being | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Smoking should not be promitted in restaurants or other public places Smoking brings a person great enjoyment and relief . However , one should not be encouraged to smoke as the cost of other people ' s health . In this case , I advocate the idea that [ smoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places , and that we should support states laws to ban it | MajorClaim ] because [ smoking not only damages the restaurant ' s environment , but also imposes a potential threat on others ' health | Claim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , although [ it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society , one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others ' health | Premise | Supports = smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned ] . It is generally believed that , [ the second - hand smoke , which comes from the smoker ' s mouth , puts an even greater threat on surrounding people ' s health than the smoker himself | Premise | Supports = smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned ] . For example , [ if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant , all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked | Premise | Supports = smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned ] . This is because [ some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person ' s respiratory system after he / she inhales it | Premise | Supports = if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant , all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked ] . Therefore , [ smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned | Claim ] because [ it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer ' s health | Premise | Supports = smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second - hand smoke imposes on them , [ the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite , or , in other words , spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience | Claim ] . [ The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted , thus affecting their mood in having their meals | Premise | Supports = the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite , or , in other words , spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience ] . [ This , on the other hand , can indirectly decrease the restaurants ' popularity | Premise | Supports = the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite , or , in other words , spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience ] because [ fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences | Premise | Supports = This , on the other hand , can indirectly decrease the restaurants ' popularity ] .

Target TANL: Lastly , [ smoking does no good to the smoker himself | Claim ] . [ Not only does it aggravate his health , making him more subject to respiratory diseases , but also it damages his public image and reputation | Premise | Supports = smoking does no good to the smoker himself ] . [ This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity | Premise | Supports = smoking does no good to the smoker himself ] , because [ most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior | Premise | Supports = This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity ] . At this point , [ the public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader | Premise | Supports = smoking does no good to the smoker himself ] .

Target TANL: To conclude , [ smoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior | Claim ] . [ It spoils the smoker ' s reputation and threats other people ' s health | Premise | Supports = smoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior ] . Therefore , [ it is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places , and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: People should have hobbies and do physical activities Whether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question . Different people have different ideas . Some people think we should focus on our jobs , but I don ' t agree with them . [ Having one ' s own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First , [ having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit | Claim ] . [ Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze | Premise | Supports = doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short - sighted ] , so [ doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short - sighted | Premise | Supports = having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit ] . [ My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company | Premise | Supports = having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit ] . [ He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise | Premise | Supports = having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit ] . [ When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend , he made up his mind to loose weight | Premise | Supports = having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit ] . [ He started to jog every morning | Premise | Supports = having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit ] . [ After a moth , he is thinner and finds a girlfriend | Premise | Supports = having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit ] .

Target TANL: Also , [ doing something for a long time can be boring | Premise | Attacks = having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind ] , [ having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind | Claim ] . For example , [ at school , students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class | Premise | Supports = having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind ] . [ Humans are not robots ; we can ' t keep working for twenty - four hours | Premise | Supports = having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind ] . [ Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries | Premise | Supports = having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind ] .

Target TANL: Last , [ we should develop at least one personal hobby , not to show off , but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured | Claim ] . [ Playing musical instrument is a good way , I can play classical guitar | Premise | Supports = we should develop at least one personal hobby , not to show off , but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured ] . [ When I meet difficulties in studies , I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves | Premise | Supports = we should develop at least one personal hobby , not to show off , but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured ] . [ It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence | Premise | Supports = we should develop at least one personal hobby , not to show off , but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured ] .

Target TANL: Although [ it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies | Claim ] , but [ doing so can bring us a healthy body , a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness | Premise | Supports = it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies ] . Hence , I think [ it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Government should regard investing in building roads as the most important The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation . Many countries have suffered from pollution , noisy and casualty for a long time . From my perspective , [ the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways | MajorClaim ] because of three crucial reasons .

Target TANL: First and foremost , [ we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents | Claim ] . [ The buses , cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia | Premise | Supports = we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents ] . Moreover , [ the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing | Premise | Supports = we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents ] . Most importantly , [ there are many accidents happening on the roads | Premise | Supports = we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents ] . For example , [ in my country , buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents | Premise | Supports = there are many accidents happening on the roads ] . Each year , [ Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan | Premise | Supports = there are many accidents happening on the roads ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work | Claim ] . [ Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads | Premise | Supports = investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work ] . For instance , [ I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home | Premise | Supports = investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work ] . [ It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour | Premise | Supports = investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work ] . In contrast , [ if the roads are enlarged , everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions | Premise | Supports = investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work ] .

Target TANL: Last but not least , [ spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality | Claim ] . [ All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes | Premise | Supports = spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality ] . [ Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried | Premise | Supports = spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality ] . [ We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents | Premise | Supports = spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality ] because [ a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities | Premise | Supports = We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents ] . [ What ' s more , a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier | Premise | Supports = spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality ] .

Target TANL: In a nutshell , [ the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable | MajorClaim ] . I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing .

Target TANL: The best way of learning life Life is full of challenges , difficulties and unexpected obstacles . Therefore , learning about life , which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed . Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience . Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages .

Target TANL: On one hand , [ the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter | Claim ] . [ Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life | Premise | Supports = the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter ] . [ And friends , people who are the same generation with you , they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you , which is not | Premise | Supports = the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter ] . [ By listening to your family and friends advice , you can definitely avoid many unexpected things | Premise | Supports = the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature | Claim ] . For one thing , [ there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don ' t experience it by yourself | Premise | Supports = finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature ] . For example , [ a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous | Premise | Supports = finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature ] . [ If you did as he told , you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely | Premise | Supports = finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature ] . In addition , [ family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time | Premise | Supports = finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature ] . [ You will grow to be dependent and reliant | Premise | Supports = finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature ] . In contrast , [ free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose | Premise | Supports = finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature ] .

Target TANL: According to myself , both ways are good , but I prefer the latter . It is because [ growth is a long process that experience is indispensable | Premise | Supports = experiencing the real life by myself , I could learn more than just obey the advice ] . I believe that [ experiencing the real life by myself , I could learn more than just obey the advice | Claim ] . Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves , why don ' t the younger try to do the same ?

Target TANL: In summary , each way learning life has its own benefits . But to me , [ learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Modern cooking methods have improved our life - style significantly With technology advances , food has become easier to prepare in modern days . People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before . Also , instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals .

For instance , [ such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job | Premise | Supports = people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time - consuming ] . On the other hand , [ more people can sleep a bit later to go to work | Premise | Supports = people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time - consuming ] because [ they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts | Premise | Supports = more people can sleep a bit later to go to work ] .

Target TANL: At the second point , [ since food preparation has become easier and more convenient , it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home | Claim ] . [ People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like | Premise | Supports = since food preparation has become easier and more convenient , it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home ] . [ More men , on the other hand , are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before | Premise | Supports = This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases ] . [ This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ the time - saving , simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities , more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals | Claim ] . Of course , there may be some other perspectives that I neglected to fully consider . Nevertheless , for the reasons that I have presented above , [ I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Are parents best teachers ? It is obvious that [ parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person | Claim ] . Moreover , [ parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children ' s future life | Claim ] .

Target TANL: First , [ children are taught basic things , which influence their whole life , by their parents | Claim ] . [ As a baby , they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents | Premise | Supports = children are taught basic things , which influence their whole life , by their parents ] . [ Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that | Premise | Supports = parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby ' s little mind ] . Consequently , [ parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby ' s little mind | Premise | Supports = children are taught basic things , which influence their whole life , by their parents ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ parents train their child how to become a good person | Claim ] . [ They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way | Premise | Supports = parents train their child how to become a good person ] . On the one hand , [ it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person | Premise | Supports = parents train their child how to become a good person ] . On the other hand , [ children are shown how to behave well with others | Premise | Supports = parents train their child how to become a good person ] . This seems to be easy but [ this can influence positively their future children and makes children ' s behavior better before they face the real world | Premise | Supports = parents train their child how to become a good person ] .

Target TANL: Third , it is clear that [ parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children | Premise | Supports = they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children ] . Thus , [ they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children | Premise | Supports = parents ' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life ] . [ Unlike a professional , parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life | Premise | Supports = parents ' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life ] . In fact , [ parents ' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice | MajorClaim ] . Based on love , they always try their best to make good condition for their children development in order to prepare children ' s future life .

Target TANL: Tv has NO negative effects on children Nowadays , we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv . Many people say that television has negative effects on children , since it can be violent or inappropriate for children . However , I strongly believe that [ television has more positive effects than negative effects | MajorClaim ] . There are two reasons to support my idea .

Target TANL: First of all , [ television has useful and educational programs | Claim ] . [ Not only the up - to - date news , but also there are many programs which has educational purposes | Premise | Supports = television has useful and educational programs ] . [ If children can use those programs wisely , they can learn many information from it | Premise | Supports = television has useful and educational programs ] . For example , [ in Korea , there ' s program called EBS | Premise | Supports = television has useful and educational programs ] . [ It is targeted for children to teenager | Premise | Supports = television has useful and educational programs ] . [ We can study subjects through EBS lecture | Premise | Supports = television has useful and educational programs ] . Also , [ there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea | Premise | Supports = television has useful and educational programs ] . [ Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects | Premise | Supports = television has useful and educational programs ] .

Target TANL: In addition , [ Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses | Claim ] . There are many Tv programs such as sports programs . [ Many children have a lot of stresses recently | Premise | Supports = Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses ] , since [ they have so much pressure about study | Premise | Supports = Many children have a lot of stresses recently ] . [ When they are watching sports programs , it ' s easy to relieve those stresses | Premise | Supports = Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses ] . As an example , [ I got too much stress from the school | Premise | Supports = I was quite aggressive ] . So , [ I was quite aggressive | Premise | Supports = Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses ] , however . [ After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan , the stress was gone | Premise | Supports = Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses ] . Instead , [ this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school | Premise | Supports = Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses ] , since [ it helped me to relieve my stress | Premise | Supports = this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , of course , [ the television can have violent programs | Claim ] , however , [ if children can use Tv programs wisely , there are more positive effects than negative effects | Premise | Attacks = the television can have violent programs ] . Now that , [ it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children | Premise | Attacks = the television can have violent programs ] . For these reasons , [ I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working . From my perspective , those assumptions are not only conservative but also out - of - date . I am biased towards the opposite side that [ businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life | MajorClaim ] because of the three main crucial reasons .

Target TANL: First and foremost , [ various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish | Claim ] . [ The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job , but regularly give out creative and novel ideas | Premise | Supports = various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish ] . What ' s more , [ the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge | Premise | Supports = the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards ] .

More importantly , [ they have activeness , inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly | Premise | Supports = the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards ] . [ These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not | Premise | Supports = the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time | Claim ] . [ At a certain time , they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary | Premise | Supports = the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time ] because [ they need to earn money to manage their life | Premise | Supports = At a certain time , they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary ] . Thereafter , [ the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons | Premise | Supports = the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time ] also . [ Many people enjoy challenging them | Premise | Supports = the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time ] because [ they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones | Premise | Supports = Many people enjoy challenging them ] . [ The same - old - same - old environment soon makes them depressed | Premise | Supports = this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise ] , so [ this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise | Premise | Supports = the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time ] .

Target TANL: Last but not least , [ the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment | Premise | Supports = the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue ] . In my opinion , [ the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue | Claim ] . [ It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living | Premise | Supports = the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue ] . Furthermore , [ the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas | Premise | Supports = the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue ] .

Target TANL: In a nutshell , varied characteristics of various people , feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that [ the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life | MajorClaim ] . I believe that the [ brilliant bosses are conscious of the need for giving opportunities to diverse employees | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Childhood is the happiest time of a person ' s life I agree with the statement that [ childhood is the happiest period of one ' s life | MajorClaim ] . [ It ' s not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives , but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ Starting with our adulthood , we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives | Premise | Supports = during our childhood , though responsibilies exist , we are much more free to do what we would like to ] . [ We are told at what hour we shall wake up , how we shall dress up and how we shall behave | Premise | Supports = during our childhood , though responsibilies exist , we are much more free to do what we would like to ] . [ Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community | Premise | Supports = during our childhood , though responsibilies exist , we are much more free to do what we would like to ] . But [ during our childhood , though responsibilies exist , we are much more free to do what we would like to | Claim ] . [ Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren ' t supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult | Premise | Supports = during our childhood , though responsibilies exist , we are much more free to do what we would like to ] .

Target TANL: [ Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day | Premise | Supports = childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most ] . [ Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you | Premise | Supports = childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most ] .

[ Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults , and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination | Premise | Supports = Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child ] . [ In adulthood , people are forced to express themselves in boundaries | Premise | Supports = they are in no way free to think or use their imagination ] , therefore [ they are in no way free to think or use their imagination | Premise | Supports = Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child ] .

Target TANL: [ Childhood , in several aspects , is the happiest period of our lives | MajorClaim ] . [ It ' s not only because of the nature of childhood and children , but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults | Claim ] . In an ideal world with less boundaries , social judgement and more freedom of thought , things could be different ; but since this is not the case , it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days .

Target TANL: Success and knowledge Many people think that " Past has nothing to do with present , as time never stops , the next generations are completely different from the predecessors " . Although it is true that [ life changes rapidly | Claim ] , [ there are many things in the past that we can learn about , such as mistakes , success and knowledge in many fields of study | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ the predecessors ' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past | Premise | Supports = past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times ] . [ As everyone ' s life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare , we all should learn about other ' s mistakes | Premise | Supports = we can avoid making the same ones ] so that [ we can avoid making the same ones | Premise | Supports = past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times ] . [ Each mistake , from the smallest to the bigger one , is a treasure of experience , which , if we can make full use of , will make us well - prepared for many complicated situations of our life | Premise | Supports = past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times ] . Therefore , [ past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ people ' s success in the past is as significant as those mistakes | Claim ] . [ If the predecessors ' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals | Premise | Supports = others ' accomplishment can be served as the direct way ] , [ others ' accomplishment can be served as the direct way | Premise | Supports = people ' s success in the past is as significant as those mistakes ] . [ By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets , we have the chance to make those mine , put them into practice and , of course , be successful like them | Premise | Supports = people ' s success in the past is as significant as those mistakes ] . For instance , [ Edison ' s statement " Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration " is still helpful for everyone today , and probably in the future | Premise | Supports = people ' s success in the past is as significant as those mistakes ] .

Target TANL: Last but not least , [ the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge , inventions | Claim ] . [ If it had not been for those knowledge in the past , we could never be as modern as today | Premise | Supports = the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge , inventions ] . [ How can America be the world ' s leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India | Premise | Supports = the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge , inventions ] .

Target TANL: Television destroys communication among friends and family Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day . Besides , watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros . However , while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families , I believe it has done the opposite . I think [ TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering | MajorClaim ] . In addition [ Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people | Claim ] .

As well as [ it ' s one way of recent communications | Claim ] , based on that I think [ TV helps you to get connected with people | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Children should grow up in a big city ! [ It’s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city | MajorClaim ] . Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood . [ I hold this belief because of two main reasons , academic and social reasons | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Some people thinks that [ if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video - game | Claim ] , but [ this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did | Premise | Attacks = if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video - game ] . [ My friends and I used to play soccer , bike , climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day | Premise | Attacks = if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video - game ] . [ We did play video - games , but that wasn ' t our main activity | Premise | Attacks = if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video - game ] . [ In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do | Premise | Attacks = if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video - game ] .

Target TANL: [ I have a friend that grew up in the countryside | Premise | Supports = In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology ] . [ He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university | Premise | Supports = In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology ] . This is another downside of growing up in the countryside . [ In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience | Claim ] , [ you won’t know a lot of people , there are gossips everywhere , and your life will be really limited | Premise | Supports = Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience ] . If someday I have children , I’m absolutely sure that [ they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Parents are the best teachers because they are more special than everybody else I completely agree that [ parents are the best teacher | MajorClaim ] . [ Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children’s lives | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ the things that parents say have great power to their child | Claim ] . [ More power than any friend or other adult could have | Premise | Supports = the things that parents say have great power to their child ] . For example , [ if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn ' t do it , but his father told him / her that it was right , the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person , even if his father is wrong | Premise | Supports = the things that parents say have great power to their child ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people | Premise | Supports = their parents have more time to teach him / her than anybody else ] , so [ their parents have more time to teach him / her than anybody else | Claim ] . [ They have more contact and more intimacy with their children | Premise | Supports = their parents have more time to teach him / her than anybody else ] .

Target TANL: Lastly , [ children usually mirror themselves on their parents | Claim ] . That’s as important thing because [ even if the parents don’t intend to teach their children something , they are always observing and learning by themselves | Premise | Supports = children usually mirror themselves on their parents ] . So , [ if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad , his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad | Premise | Supports = children usually mirror themselves on their parents ] .

Target TANL: All in all , I agree that [ parents are the greatest teachers | MajorClaim ] and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child , because it can define who he is going to be .

Target TANL: Easy preparation of food leads to a better life The Technology has developed a lot . With that development , food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to . With that change , people’s lives are a lot better for several reasons . Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ people normally have lots of things to do | Premise | Supports = they don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen ] . Because of that , [ they don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen | Premise | Supports = being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome ] . But [ being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome | Claim ] . For example , [ if an engineer needs to make a project , but he needs to deliver it tomorrow , he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch | Premise | Supports = being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason , some time ago he / she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food , but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food | Claim ] . For example , [ if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend , he could just buy some food that comes with instructions | Premise | Supports = when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason , some time ago he / she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food , but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food ] . [ Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time | Premise | Supports = when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason , some time ago he / she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food , but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food ] .

Target TANL: All in all , that [ ease to prepare food has improved people’s lives | MajorClaim ] . And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology . [ But people should be careful with what they eat | Claim ] , because [ some industrial foods are very bad for their health | Premise | Supports = they should buy only food from well known brands ] , so [ they should buy only food from well known brands | Premise | Supports = But people should be careful with what they eat ] .

Target TANL: Should University education be free for everyone interested ? A famous proverb “Knowledge is power” has demonstrated the value of education . I believe that [ universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars | MajorClaim ] because [ now - a - days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability | Claim ] . I have observed that [ many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities | Premise | Supports = now - a - days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability ] because [ they have to think about work along with the studies , and this left them with only one choice , which is work | Premise | Supports = many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities ] .

Target TANL: [ University is more likely to become a money making business | Premise | Supports = the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students ] , [ the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students | Claim ] . [ In today’s world education is getting expensive , and people are tending to apply for self - finance education in order to get the admission | Premise | Supports = the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students ] . Whereas , [ the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education , they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation , food , traveling , clothing , etc | Premise | Supports = the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , [ it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance , working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars , they need to concentrate on their studies | Premise | Supports = The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities ] . [ MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work , which takes their full concentration and surveys | Premise | Supports = The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities ] . [ The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Therefore , [ universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars ; their message should be spread education , not making money , and motivate those scholars who want to get education | MajorClaim ] . Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate .

Target TANL: Should professors doing more research or educating students more ? Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing , teaching , we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with , doing research . In my opinion , [ a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students | MajorClaim ] for a few reasons following .

Target TANL: [ A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject | Premise | Supports = he or she could push him / herself forward all the time ] . [ He or she should always keep the passion in her field | Premise | Supports = he or she could push him / herself forward all the time ] so that [ he or she could push him / herself forward all the time | Claim ] . And then [ he or she can do better in teaching works | Premise | Supports = he or she could push him / herself forward all the time ] . For instance , [ the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr . Yang who keeps in researching and reading | Premise | Supports = he or she could push him / herself forward all the time ] . [ He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves | Premise | Supports = he or she could push him / herself forward all the time ] . [ All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA , the excellent teacher | Premise | Supports = he or she could push him / herself forward all the time ] .

Target TANL: [ As for students , we can get what we want to know from textbooks , webs or teachers | Premise | Supports = If a professor doesn ' t get any researching works , he cannot give us the opportunity ] . But [ we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted | Premise | Supports = If a professor doesn ' t get any researching works , he cannot give us the opportunity ] . [ If a professor doesn ' t get any researching works , he cannot give us the opportunity | Claim ] . In addition , [ a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time | Claim ] . [ He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions | Premise | Supports = a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time ] . [ That is good for both of the professor and students | Premise | Supports = a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time ] .

Target TANL: Finally , [ all professors in the university are fortune of the society | Premise | Supports = Without their research , there will be no new technologies come out quickly ] . [ They are the leaders almost in every fields of science , arts , culture and so on | Premise | Supports = Without their research , there will be no new technologies come out quickly ] . [ Without their research , there will be no new technologies come out quickly | Claim ] . [ Without their research , there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing | Premise | Supports = Without their research , there will be no new technologies come out quickly ] . [ Without their research , there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth | Premise | Supports = Without their research , there will be no new technologies come out quickly ] .

Target TANL: Television and Movies influence our lives both negatively and positively There is no doubt that television or movies influence people’s behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways . But I think [ in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways | MajorClaim ] . [ They make people to eat more rubbish food , spend less time with their friends and family , and be someone that are not themselves | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television | Claim ] . [ Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas | Premise | Supports = There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television ] . [ It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people’s health | Premise | Supports = There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television ] . [ Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods | Premise | Supports = There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television ] . [ In turn , people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases | Premise | Supports = There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television ] .

Target TANL: [ Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends , especially children | Claim ] . [ They communicate less with their parents | Premise | Supports = Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends , especially children ] because [ a lot of their time is used watching television and movies | Premise | Supports = They communicate less with their parents ] . [ When people are watching television or movies together , they also talk less to each other , compare to when playing social games , such as parlor games , together | Premise | Supports = Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends , especially children ] .

Target TANL: Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements . [ These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images | Claim ] . [ When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements , they think that they are ugly | Premise | Supports = they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body ] . Thus [ they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body | Premise | Supports = These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images ] . [ When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him , then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don’t prefer it | Premise | Supports = These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images ] .

Target TANL: I think [ television and movies are entertaining | Claim ] but [ most of the time they influence people’s behavior in bad ways | MajorClaim ] . If you want to stay healthy , be yourself and spend time with your family and friends , then you should spend less time watching these media .

Target TANL: Reasons why travelers visit Museums ? Many people like to visit museums when they travel to new places , other people don ' t like to visit museums . [ I personaly tend to visit museums when I ' m in a new place | MajorClaim ] because [ it ' s good for me know about the culture , tradition and history of other places | Claim ] .

Target TANL: The first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that [ museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place | Claim ] , as I said back . [ And also taking the chance for making friends | Premise | Supports = museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place ] . [ Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations | Premise | Supports = museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place ] . [ And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you | Premise | Supports = museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place ] .

Target TANL: In coclusion , [ the museums are a visual source to know the history , tradition and culture of any place in the world | Claim ] . I think [ it ' s fun and educational | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: A man ' s manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues Once a celebrity said : A man ' s manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues . Recently , the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners . They are being rude towards others . Due to this phenomenon , someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other . Obviously , I do not agree with such kind of altitudes , the explanations I explored would be stated as following .

Target TANL: First of all , [ a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression | Claim ] . [ Through those impressions , a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible | Premise | Supports = a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression ] . For example , [ I worked in a new company , if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well , my new colleagues will accept me , even then I will be approved by the employers | Premise | Supports = a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression ] . [ In opposite situation if I am being rude , I can not get along well with each other | Premise | Supports = a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression ] . Finally , [ I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job | Premise | Supports = a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ people will get respect from politeness within each other | Claim ] . [ Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need | Premise | Supports = people will get respect from politeness within each other ] . [ A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure | Premise | Supports = people will get respect from politeness within each other ] . [ There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed | Premise | Supports = people will get respect from politeness within each other ] , because [ from their behaviors , they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity | Premise | Supports = There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed ] .

Target TANL: Finally , [ the society needs a civilized environment and orders | Claim ] . And [ a degree of social civilization depend on its people ' s qualities | Premise | Supports = the society needs a civilized environment and orders ] . [ In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings , our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners | Premise | Supports = the society needs a civilized environment and orders ] . [ Benefit from those effective measures , there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate | Premise | Supports = the society needs a civilized environment and orders ] .

Target TANL: All in all , I suppose that [ people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does With the development of the economy , people become more and more rich . They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness . While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people , I believe that [ living environment is more important than job for most of us | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Admittedly , [ job can bring us happiness | Claim ] . [ People can receive a sense of values and respected from job | Premise | Supports = job can bring us happiness ] . [ If people receive respect from others , they will feel achievement and self - confidence | Premise | Supports = job can bring us happiness ] . In addition , [ job can provide money to us | Claim ] .

Target TANL: However , [ people should concern more about their living environment than job | Claim ] . First , [ for most of us , job is only a tool to maintain our lives | Premise | Supports = people should concern more about their living environment than job ] . [ Few people can feel happiness from their job | Premise | Supports = people should concern more about their living environment than job ] because [ they have to continue to work more than 30 years | Premise | Supports = Few people can feel happiness from their job ] . For example , [ Workers in the FOXCONN factory , which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company , just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day | Premise | Supports = Few people can feel happiness from their job ] . [ These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness | Premise | Supports = Few people can feel happiness from their job ] because [ they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work | Premise | Supports = These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs , which are the most fundamental requirements for people | Claim ] . [ Without beautiful environment , people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety | Premise | Supports = beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs , which are the most fundamental requirements for people ] . [ Nowadays , the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly | Premise | Supports = beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs , which are the most fundamental requirements for people ] . [ Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil | Premise | Supports = beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs , which are the most fundamental requirements for people ] . [ In order to build city and factory , people destroy huge forests | Premise | Supports = beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs , which are the most fundamental requirements for people ] . [ In China , some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick | Premise | Supports = beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs , which are the most fundamental requirements for people ] because [ these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people | Premise | Supports = In China , some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick ] . Even though [ local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories | Premise | Attacks = beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs , which are the most fundamental requirements for people ] , [ they cannot feel happiness from high - paying job | Premise | Attacks = local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories ] yet because [ most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases | Premise | Supports = they cannot feel happiness from high - paying job ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work | MajorClaim ] since [ the goal people is for good livers | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Television has more bad than good in respect of bonds with family and friends There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost . Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium , it is a very cost - effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences . However , from my point of view , [ television has more bad than good | MajorClaim ] because [ it has made people not to have conversation each other | Claim ] .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ television shows make people forget what is really important | Claim ] . [ One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air | Premise | Supports = they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time ] . Thus , [ they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time | Premise | Supports = television shows make people forget what is really important ] since [ they think the programs are so crucial to their lives | Premise | Supports = they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time ] . [ One of my friends , for example , once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show " Infinete Challenges " | Premise | Supports = they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time ] . [ This is not only about basketball , but also about our friendship , which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other | Premise | Supports = they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time ] . That is , [ watching television alone at home , my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us | Premise | Supports = they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , [ even when people watch television together , there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television | Claim ] . [ Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone | Premise | Supports = it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness ] . Thus , [ it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness | Premise | Supports = even when people watch television together , there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television ] . To illustrate my point , [ it is reported that most of people don ' t converse with their family when they are watching television together | Premise | Supports = it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness ] . [ It is natural they behave in that way | Premise | Supports = it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness ] because [ television shows don ' t require any participation | Premise | Supports = It is natural they behave in that way ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I firmly believe that [ it is detrimental to communication among members in group , family or friends or whatever , to sit in front of television and just stare forward | MajorClaim ] . [ It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Haste makes waste This saying is stating that [ every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one | MajorClaim ] . In my opinion , this statement is completely true , for these few reasons :

Target TANL: For one thing , [ making a quick decision means that it ' s not very thought out , and that it hasn ' t been checked from all its aspects | Premise | Supports = making quick decisions leads to probable bad results ] . Consequently , [ making quick decisions leads to probable bad results | Claim ] . For example : [ if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative , or a plan B , he could end up being unemployed , because of his speedy decision | Premise | Supports = making quick decisions leads to probable bad results ] .

Target TANL: In addition , [ making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity | Claim ] . In another word , [ if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn ' t have missed out on the job opening in the same firm , but at a different position | Premise | Supports = he wouldn ' t have been unemployed ] . Hence , [ he wouldn ' t have been unemployed | Premise | Supports = making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity ] .

Target TANL: Not to mention , that [ hasty decisions , not only goes to waste , but also , could affect the entire life of the person | Claim ] . [ To put it differently , is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed , he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs | Premise | Supports = his life had taken a turn to the worst ] , thus , [ his life had taken a turn to the worst | Premise | Supports = hasty decisions , not only goes to waste , but also , could affect the entire life of the person ] .

Target TANL: As can be seen from this , is that [ a hurried decision is almost never a good one | MajorClaim ] . That ' s why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly , to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him .

Target TANL: People are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life . Many people own cars and use them daily , which clearly shows how important they are . Generally speaking , I definitely agree with the statement that [ cars have improved modern life | MajorClaim ] , for several reasons .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time , which leads to numerous advantages | Premise | Supports = Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances ] . For example in relationships . [ Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances | Claim ] because [ they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle | Premise | Supports = Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances ] . From my personal experience I recall that [ my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city | Premise | Supports = Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances ] . [ I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away | Premise | Supports = Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances ] . [ Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today | Premise | Supports = Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances ] . [ Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship | Premise | Supports = Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances ] .

Target TANL: In addition , [ cars increase the chance of employment | Claim ] because [ people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home | Premise | Supports = cars increase the chance of employment ] . Furthermore , [ they are more flexible | Premise | Supports = cars increase the chance of employment ] . [ My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money | Premise | Supports = cars increase the chance of employment ] . [ He used his car to drive to the other end of the country , worked there during the week and came home for the weekend | Premise | Supports = cars increase the chance of employment ] . [ If he had no car , he wouldn ' t be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms | Premise | Supports = cars increase the chance of employment ] .

Target TANL: Finally , [ the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world | Premise | Supports = people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world ] . [ If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life | Premise | Supports = people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world ] . [ They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas | Premise | Supports = people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world ] . [ There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car | Premise | Supports = people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world ] . As a result , [ people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that [ cars cause a lot of pollution | Claim ] because [ they provide flexibility , which is important in nearly all areas of life | Premise | Attacks = cars cause a lot of pollution ] . [ Travelling , social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Choosing the job that is similar to parents ' jobs could benefit to one ' s career When choosing a job , one need to consider it thoroughly . Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents ' job or not , different people may hold different opinions . As far as I am concerned , I think [ choosing the job that is similar to parents ' jobs could benefit to one ' s career | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ as parents are involved in the same environmen | Premise | Supports = they could thus support much more to their children , such as domain knowledge and industry - related information ]t , [ they could thus support much more to their children , such as domain knowledge and industry - related information | Claim ] . For example , [ my father is a software programmer , and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge | Premise | Supports = they could thus support much more to their children , such as domain knowledge and industry - related information ] . [ Whenever I met a difficulty , I would reach him for consulting | Premise | Supports = they could thus support much more to their children , such as domain knowledge and industry - related information ] . Because [ he has many experiences | Premise | Supports = I could save enormous time in finding solution ] , [ I could save enormous time in finding solution | Premise | Supports = they could thus support much more to their children , such as domain knowledge and industry - related information ] . [ This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues | Premise | Supports = they could thus support much more to their children , such as domain knowledge and industry - related information ] . [ If I worked in the different field from my father , I would have faced much difficulty than I do now | Premise | Supports = they could thus support much more to their children , such as domain knowledge and industry - related information ] .

Target TANL: Nevertheless , since [ parents have worked in tens of years | Premise | Supports = they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry ] , [ they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry | Premise | Supports = They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children ] . [ They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children | Claim ] . For instance , [ they know which company has better welfare or provides better education | Premise | Supports = They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children ] . Moreover , [ their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies | Premise | Supports = They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children ] . [ It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society | Premise | Supports = their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies ] . [ When others are still struggling in preparing their resume , one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process | Premise | Supports = their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies ] .

Target TANL: Some may argue that as time is different , [ the condition of job market is completely different | Premise | Supports = choosing a job similar to one ' s parents ' is not always a correct decision ] . Therefore , [ choosing a job similar to one ' s parents ' is not always a correct decision | Claim ] . I agree with this opinion to some extent , but [ when it comes to the trend , no one can predict it correctly | Premise | Attacks = choosing a job similar to one ' s parents ' is not always a correct decision ] . [ The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash | Premise | Supports = there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more ] , so that [ there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more | Premise | Supports = choosing a job similar to one ' s parents ' is not always a correct decision ] .

Target TANL: In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents ' , I have mentioned a few reasons that [ one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry | Claim ] . I believe [ parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Should parents limit their children watching TV to make them do well in school ? In 19th century , television is one of an significant inventions and has become a indispensible appliance in every house . For its accessible and containing fancy programs , television attracts audiences from a wide range of age and background . Children , who are addicted to TV , causes broad argument about whether they should be limited in watching television in amount of time . As far as I am concerned , I agree with that [ children should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ children generally have weak self - control , and thus they lose their time easily | Premise | Supports = Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents ] . [ Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents | Claim ] . I , in my childhood , was just a typical case . [ Whenever I back to home from school , the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours | Premise | Supports = I , therefore , did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying ] . [ I could watch TV for hours , but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes | Premise | Supports = I , therefore , did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying ] . [ I could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing , but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook | Premise | Supports = I , therefore , did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying ] . [ I , therefore , did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying | Premise | Supports = Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , [ sometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children | Premise | Supports = there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health ] . [ Children are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad | Premise | Supports = they are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity ] , therefore [ they are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity | Premise | Supports = there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health ] . [ Recently , more and more children smoke | Premise | Supports = there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health ] because [ they imitate actors ' behaviors on TV or movies | Premise | Supports = Recently , more and more children smoke ] . What ' s even worse , [ according to some statistics , there are more and more children have violent tendency , and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies | Premise | Supports = there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health ] . It is obvious that [ there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health | Claim ] . How can anyone expect children could do well at school if they have those abnormal behaviors ?

Target TANL: Admittedly , in concerning the social relationship with peers , some may support that [ children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation | Claim ] . I agree with this viewpoint to some extent . However , [ it doesn ' t mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching | Premise | Attacks = children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation ] .

Target TANL: [ In considering whether the time children watching on TV or movies should be constrained , I hold a strongly positive point of view toward this issue | MajorClaim ] . Because [ children are poor at time management , and are less mature to make a good judgment , they cannot be too serious to be taken care when watching TV and movies | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Should we pay professional athletes ( entertainers ) a high salary ? Professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine . Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this . This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question - do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money ? From my prospect , I believe that [ they do deserve this high payment | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ a worker ' s salary can properly reflect his / her competence and value on his / her career | Premise | Supports = those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways ] . Therefore , [ those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways | Claim ] . [ They are not paid for no reason | Premise | Supports = those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways ] . [ As we are now live in a competent world , we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment | Premise | Supports = those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways ] . [ It ' s all the same in every profession | Premise | Supports = those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways ] . That ' s why [ the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields , namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods | Premise | Supports = those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete ' s great performances | Claim ] . [ Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they ' ve gone through and how much cost they ' ve thrown into investing themselves | Premise | Supports = such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete ' s great performances ] . [ They shall reap within their high salaries | Premise | Supports = such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete ' s great performances ] . In other words , [ if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances , there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed | Premise | Supports = such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete ' s great performances ] .

Target TANL: Some people might argue that [ the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair | Claim ] . However , in my opinion , [ as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his / her dreams and careers , that would be fair | Premise | Attacks = the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair ] . [ Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone , but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment | Premise | Attacks = the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances | MajorClaim ] . [ It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment , giving us awesome performances to enjoy | Claim ] .

Target TANL: People who can’t accept others’ criticism can’t succeed in group working In everyday life we encounter different people , and we receive different opinions about us or our works , no matter positive or negative . It might be easy to take praises but hard to accept criticism . Therefore , here goes the point that [ people who can ' t accept others ' criticism can ' t succeed in group working | MajorClaim ] . Personally , I agree with this statement .

Target TANL: First , [ the core of group working is " consensus " | Claim ] . [ It ' s the idea that everyone’s opinion accounts | Premise | Supports = the core of group working is " consensus " ] . [ In group works , group members gather together to have brain - storming discussion , think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement | Premise | Supports = the core of group working is " consensus " ] . In this long process of discussion , there must be different opinions sparkling out . [ It doesn ' t work if one member solely insists on his / her idea and doesn ' t take other member ' s criticism | Premise | Supports = the core of group working is " consensus " ] because [ the work belongs to every member , not a personal show for specific one member | Premise | Supports = It doesn ' t work if one member solely insists on his / her idea and doesn ' t take other member ' s criticism ] . [ It ' s every member ' s duty to respect other ' s opinion | Premise | Supports = the core of group working is " consensus " ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone ' s opinion that is against you | Premise | Supports = Even if you are not working in a group , you still need to take others ' criticism ] . [ Even if you are not working in a group , you still need to take others ' criticism | Claim ] . [ Criticism definitely hurts | Premise | Attacks = Even if you are not working in a group , you still need to take others ' criticism ] because [ it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them | Premise | Supports = Criticism definitely hurts ] . However , [ criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it | Premise | Attacks = Criticism definitely hurts ] . [ Those who don ' t even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved | Premise | Supports = Even if you are not working in a group , you still need to take others ' criticism ] . In other words , [ if you can ' t take any criticism , not only will you fail in cooperating with other people , but also get defeated in personal works | Premise | Supports = Even if you are not working in a group , you still need to take others ' criticism ] . [ As one Chinese idiom goes : " The good medicine tastes bitter“ | Premise | Supports = Even if you are not working in a group , you still need to take others ' criticism ] . [ Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal | Premise | Supports = Even if you are not working in a group , you still need to take others ' criticism ] .

Target TANL: However , some people might ask : what if the criticism proves to be wrong ? What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction ? Doesn ' t insistence also a good character ? In my point of view , [ even if you are right , criticism is still helpful | Claim ] because [ in this case it not only is a fixer , but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work | Premise | Supports = even if you are right , criticism is still helpful ] . [ Taking criticism doesn ' t necessary mean that you have to take it all | Premise | Supports = even if you are right , criticism is still helpful ] . [ You should have your own judgments too | Premise | Supports = even if you are right , criticism is still helpful ] ! [ And it ' s kind of art to make the best use of criticism | Premise | Supports = even if you are right , criticism is still helpful ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism | MajorClaim ] . It ' s just like a picky mirror through which we can see the bad side of us and thus try to become more beautiful and confident .

Target TANL: How teachers can make the subject interesting to students ! There are many ways of teaching . Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching , while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing . In my opinion , I agree with the second idea that [ the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life , students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject | Claim ] . [ Take chemistry for example , merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring , while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class | Premise | Supports = by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life , students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject ] . [ While I was in senior high school , my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas | Premise | Supports = by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life , students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject ] . [ This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good | Premise | Supports = by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life , students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject ] . [ I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget , even though now I ' m not studying chemistry anymore | Premise | Supports = by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life , students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ by bridging the theories with daily life events , students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem - solving | Claim ] . [ This will address students ' interests | Premise | Supports = by bridging the theories with daily life events , students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem - solving ] because [ it ' s the assignment that needs real life participation | Premise | Supports = This will address students ' interests ] . For example , [ in law class , students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them | Premise | Supports = by bridging the theories with daily life events , students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem - solving ] . [ When any one of the situations occurs , they can think independently and figure out how to react | Premise | Supports = by bridging the theories with daily life events , students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem - solving ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students ' attention and keep them eager on learning | MajorClaim ] , not only because [ it reinforces students ' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own | Claim ] .

Target TANL: University students should attend classes or not ? In university education , students are given much independence in the ways of learning . Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses , while some students don ' t feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams . These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations . In my opinion , I believe that [ students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First , [ in terms of learning , attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams | Claim ] . [ Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students | Premise | Supports = in terms of learning , attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams ] . [ Professors not only have the knowledge , but also equip with experiences , knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements | Premise | Supports = in terms of learning , attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ it ' s students ' basic responsibility to attend class | Premise | Supports = class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances ] . [ Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves | Premise | Supports = class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances ] . [ Many professors grade their students with class attendances | Premise | Supports = class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances ] . In other words , [ class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances | Claim ] . [ Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn ' t show up in the classes | Premise | Supports = class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances ] .

Target TANL: Some people might argue that [ if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own | Claim ] . Why wasting time going to classes ? Doesn ' t self - study more efficient ? However , in my opinion , [ this is a rather immodest way of thinking | Premise | Attacks = if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own ] . I believe that [ professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors | Premise | Attacks = if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own ] . Besides , [ even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors , they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates | Premise | Attacks = if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes | MajorClaim ] . [ It ' s an essential learning process | Claim ] . Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning . The learning process itself , however , is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student .

Target TANL: What ' s more important : hard work or luck ? What do you think when you see a beautiful building ? And also when you see an airport ? Do you think they have built by chance ? Of course don ' t . Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google , Yahoo etc . created by chance . Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success , but to be frank I cannot agree with them . I would explore my primary reasons here .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people | Claim ] . [ Hard work make you a professional man / woman which are powerful in his or her job | Premise | Supports = famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people ] . I mean , [ when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success | Premise | Supports = famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people ] . For example [ in football game it is said that penalty - kick need good chance to be goal | Premise | Supports = famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people ] . [ Statically the chance of being goal is fifty - fifty | Premise | Supports = in football game it is said that penalty - kick need good chance to be goal ] . [ But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty - kick with more possibility than me | Premise | Attacks = in football game it is said that penalty - kick need good chance to be goal ] . [ It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me | Premise | Attacks = in football game it is said that penalty - kick need good chance to be goal ] . [ Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me | Premise | Supports = It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me ] . [ He do a lot of exercise in football field every day | Premise | Supports = it is not for which he is luckier than me ] , so [ it is not for which he is luckier than me | Premise | Supports = It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , [ we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful | Claim ] . [ I don ' t want to disavow the role of luck in success , but as you know it hardly accompany us | Premise | Supports = we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful ] . So , for example [ you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple - choice test which has four option to choose in every question | Premise | Supports = it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam ] . [ You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck , even if you be a very lucky | Premise | Supports = it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam ] . [ If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam | Premise | Supports = it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam ] . Undoubtedly [ it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam | Premise | Supports = we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful ] .

Target TANL: Finally , [ you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way | Premise | Supports = The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance ] . [ The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance | Claim ] . [ These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his / her work | Premise | Supports = The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance ] . Undoubtedly [ such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works | Premise | Supports = The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance ] .

Target TANL: In the end , I think [ any great success need great work not great luck | MajorClaim ] , even though [ luck is one factor in reaching goal | Claim ] but [ its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans | Premise | Attacks = luck is one factor in reaching goal ] .

Target TANL: Sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own Different people prefer different styles of learning . I think [ both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful | MajorClaim ] . [ Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning | Claim ] . Another important point is that [ for practical subjects you have to have a teacher | Claim ] . On the other hand , [ sometimes I would rather learning on my own | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier | Premise | Supports = I will learn faster and better and won ' t get discouraged and confused ] . [ Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available , I get discouraged after spending a lot of time | Premise | Supports = I will learn faster and better and won ' t get discouraged and confused ] . [ In this situation , I ' ll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her | Premise | Supports = I will learn faster and better and won ' t get discouraged and confused ] . [ And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time | Premise | Supports = I will learn faster and better and won ' t get discouraged and confused ] and therefore [ I will learn faster and better and won ' t get discouraged and confused | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor | Claim ] . For example , [ if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming , you ' ll have to find a teacher | Premise | Supports = There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor ] . [ It ' s almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own | Premise | Supports = if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming , you ' ll have to find a teacher ] . By the way , [ if you are going to learn some things by yourself , you may learn and understand them incorrectly | Premise | Supports = There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor ] ! For example , [ from my own experiences , after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher , I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo , but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits , I was able to play properly | Premise | Supports = if you are going to learn some things by yourself , you may learn and understand them incorrectly ] .

Target TANL: [ There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher | Claim ] because [ I won ' t have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes | Premise | Supports = There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher ] . [ In today ' s world there are many great and useful sources available like books , electronic books , the internet and TV and satellite | Premise | Supports = There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher ] . [ I can utilize them as tutorials for many things | Premise | Supports = There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher ] . For instance , [ I can learn English or other languages by a lot of helpful books and many online websites | Premise | Supports = There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher ] .

Target TANL: In sum , sometimes [ it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own | Claim ] . In my view , [ both can help and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Once you are unique enough , you are already on the way to success Achieving success is everybody ' s goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success . Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances , while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else . Which one is the promising way to succeed ? In my opinion , I believe that [ once you are unique enough , you are already on the way to success | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First , [ being positively different from everyone else usually means that you ' ve achieved something that is superior than others | Premise | Supports = If you don ' t make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others , you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you ] . [ As living in a competent world , we are like playing a survival game | Premise | Supports = If you don ' t make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others , you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you ] . [ Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive | Premise | Supports = If you don ' t make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others , you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you ] . [ If you don ' t make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others , you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you | Claim ] . Take myself for example , [ when I was in college , I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report | Premise | Supports = If you don ' t make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others , you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you ] because [ I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently | Premise | Supports = when I was in college , I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others | Claim ] . In other words , [ once you are special and unique , pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you | Premise | Supports = being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others ] . [ Take the most popular and prestigious technology company - Apple - for example | Premise | Supports = being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others ] . [ The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors | Premise | Supports = Take the most popular and prestigious technology company - Apple - for example ] . [ It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers | Premise | Supports = Take the most popular and prestigious technology company - Apple - for example ] . [ It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value | Premise | Supports = Take the most popular and prestigious technology company - Apple - for example ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ being different and unique is the better way to achieve success | MajorClaim ] . [ It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value , making you take the lead in your way towards success | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Younger school children should study art and music Undoubtedly , math , language , science and history are all extremely important subjects in student ' s education since these subjects provide students the basic understanding of the world . Therefore , some people assert that there is no need to learn other subjects for younger students . Nevertheless , [ the art and music , from my point of view , are also essential for younger student ' s future life | Claim ] because [ those subjects help students learn this planet from another perspective and they can release people from the enormous pressure nowadays | Premise | Supports = the art and music , from my point of view , are also essential for younger student ' s future life ] . In this case , I would definitely agree that [ the art and music should be required to study | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ art and music would broaden student ' s horizon and therefore make them thoughtful | Claim ] . [ It is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border , and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures | Premise | Supports = art and music would broaden student ' s horizon and therefore make them thoughtful ] . Under this circumstance , [ learning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures | Premise | Supports = art and music would broaden student ' s horizon and therefore make them thoughtful ] . For instance , [ students are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny - Beethoven ' s most notable workpiece is played | Premise | Supports = learning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures ] .

Target TANL: In addition , [ studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax | Claim ] . Obviously , [ with the improvement of life rhythm , people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs , and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself | Premise | Supports = studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax ] . [ Art and music are , of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life | Premise | Supports = studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax ] . [ When enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings , such as the Mona Lisa , people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for | Premise | Supports = Art and music are , of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life ] . At this moment , [ they would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved | Premise | Supports = Art and music are , of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life ] . Apparently , [ this sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art | Premise | Supports = Art and music are , of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life ] .

Target TANL: Admittedly , [ the study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student ' s own interest | Premise | Supports = the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student ' s interest of art without adding extra study pressure ] . [ The education of art and music would not work if students resist it | Premise | Supports = the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student ' s interest of art without adding extra study pressure ] . Thus , [ the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student ' s interest of art without adding extra study pressure | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In a nutshell , [ in the modern society , since understanding of the lengthen and depth of the world is important and meanwhile people have burdened excessive pressure | Claim ] , [ younger students ' art and music education should not take the second place | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Challenges are different from generation to generation While debating about generation issues , people always have different opinions . Some people believe that little things changed through generation , while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way . In my opinion , I believe that [ every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First , [ under globalization and industrial integration , the work - related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging | Claim ] . The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid - changing world . [ In the past , focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems | Premise | Supports = under globalization and industrial integration , the work - related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging ] because [ every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage | Premise | Supports = under globalization and industrial integration , the work - related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging ] . However , [ as those industries expand and become internationalized , people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges | Premise | Supports = under globalization and industrial integration , the work - related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging ] . For example , [ now there are more chances to do business with people around the world | Premise | Supports = besides one ' s own profession , language ability is essential as well ] , so [ besides one ' s own profession , language ability is essential as well | Premise | Supports = as those industries expand and become internationalized , people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges ] . For another example , [ financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century | Premise | Supports = surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management ] , thus [ surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management | Premise | Supports = as those industries expand and become internationalized , people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ this generation is encountering the self - recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation | Claim ] . [ The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them | Premise | Supports = this generation is encountering the self - recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation ] . In contrast , [ young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually | Claim ] . [ They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want | Premise | Supports = young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually ] . [ It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them | Premise | Supports = young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually ] . [ They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences | Premise | Supports = young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation , whether in career or in self - identification | MajorClaim ] . It is hard to judge which generation ' s problems are more difficult but [ it is no doubt that until the next generation , there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Whether it is better to have broad knowledge or not Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject . Some people believe that having a broad knowledge can give you a higher chance to success , while others think that professional in a specific subject is the key to enroll a success . Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason . As far as I am concerned , [ having a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success | MajorClaim ] . The following will present my points .

Target TANL: First of all , [ when one knows different region ' s works , it will help one to get a friend much easier | Claim ] . For example , I worked in a large company , which has many different departments . I was in the Management Information System department . What we do every day is to solve the problem that our clients asked in the phone . [ While some of the problems are the Engineering department ' s part , I went there and discussed with the colleagues there | Premise | Supports = when one knows different region ' s works , it will help one to get a friend much easier ] , since [ I have studied some of the engineering courses | Premise | Supports = While some of the problems are the Engineering department ' s part , I went there and discussed with the colleagues there ] . [ It is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department , which made me popular there , and much easier to get the help that I need | Premise | Supports = when one knows different region ' s works , it will help one to get a friend much easier ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ when you want to translate your major , it is important to know some of the things about different fields | Claim ] . Take my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example . They majored in financing when they were in college . But , they decided to enroll in the art system after graduated . [ Thanks to Jeff ' s hard working during his leisure time , he learned a lot about the history of art | Premise | Supports = when you want to translate your major , it is important to know some of the things about different fields ] . [ Things ended up that he joined in a great team , while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank | Premise | Supports = when you want to translate your major , it is important to know some of the things about different fields ] .

Target TANL: Although I agree with the idea that knowing different fields is important . I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view . People who hold different opinion may argue that [ if one can’t success one’s own major , what else things he can do in different filed | Claim ] . Of course , it may be true when talking about this topic . However , [ what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed | Premise | Attacks = if one can’t success one’s own major , what else things he can do in different filed ] . In this way , it won’t be a problem at all .

Target TANL: In conclusion , given the reasons described above , when the advantages and disadvantages of whether having the knowledge in different fields is better or not are carefully compared . The best choice is obviously stand on my side , which is that [ a broad knowledge of different subjects is really important | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Successful people try new things and take risks I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks . There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are . In my opinion , one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that [ successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things | Claim ] . The other reason is that [ great success requires taking great risks | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things | Premise | Supports = These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books ] . For example , [ if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people , you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places | Premise | Supports = These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books ] . [ By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities | Premise | Supports = you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future ] and as a result [ you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future | Premise | Supports = These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books ] . [ These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books | Claim ] .

Target TANL: I do believe that [ great success requires taking great risks | Premise | Supports = it is important to take risks ] . [ If you want to gain very high profits in investments , you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money | Premise | Supports = it is important to take risks ] . [ If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam , you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies | Premise | Supports = it is important to take risks ] . [ The more you take risks , the greater your successes will be | Premise | Supports = it is important to take risks ] . [ If you don’t take any risks , you will have an ordinary life with average successes | Premise | Supports = it is important to take risks ] . That’s why [ it is important to take risks | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In sum , I believe that [ success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: TV has adverse effects on friends and family Nowdays there are different resources to entertain , educate and inform people . One of this resource is television ; however television has some negative effects among some people . Therefore , I agree that [ Television has destroyed communication among friends and family | MajorClaim ] . [ Some People spend a lot of time watching television , others even eat watching television , and some others make of this media a priority | Claim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ some people spend a lot of time watching television | Claim ] . [ Instead of spend time with family and friends , they like to seat on a chair for hours | Premise | Supports = some people spend a lot of time watching television ] . [ I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on , he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours | Premise | Supports = some people spend a lot of time watching television ] . [ Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work , but he only let her talk during commercials | Premise | Supports = she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email ] . So , [ she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email | Premise | Supports = some people spend a lot of time watching television ] . [ Time with the family is gold , some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them | Premise | Supports = some people spend a lot of time watching television ] .

Target TANL: [ Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family | Claim ] . [ This is the time , when if they have children , they can share everything about school , a project and even concerns | Premise | Supports = Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family ] . Also , [ when there is a dinner with friends , some people do not have a fluid conversation | Premise | Supports = Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family ] because [ the television is again in between them | Premise | Supports = when there is a dinner with friends , some people do not have a fluid conversation ] . [ When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking , this is not the reality in some cases | Premise | Supports = Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family ] .

Target TANL: Finally , [ some people make the television a priority | Claim ] . [ I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night | Premise | Supports = some people make the television a priority ] . Honestly , I was in shock ! How she could say that to me ? .

Target TANL: As I have said , [ television is a great tool to learn , entertain and inform what is happening | Claim ] , but I agree that [ television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority , spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Spending equal amount of money on libraries and sports ? University students can be divided into two groups , one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students . Usually the second group ' s members do not have enough time to do exercise . We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life . But [ I don ' t think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First , in my view [ spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football / basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports | Claim ] . For example , [ my roommate , Mary , always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory | Premise | Supports = spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football / basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports ] . [ When she gets to the dorm , she is really full of energy and after taking a shower , she is ready to start a good day | Premise | Supports = spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football / basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports ] . As you see , [ she is doing exercise without spending a cent | Premise | Supports = spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football / basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports ] . [ What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus , inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health | Premise | Supports = spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football / basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports ] .

Target TANL: In addition , [ students choose their major based on their interests | Premise | Supports = The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students ] . [ The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students | Claim ] . Because [ their major in completely involved in physical activities | Premise | Supports = The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students ] . In contrast , [ for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories | Premise | Supports = The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students ] , because [ it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field | Premise | Supports = for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories ] .

Target TANL: Finally , [ spending money on social activities looks like wasting money | Claim ] . [ For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people , university programs are the last place they would choose | Premise | Supports = spending money on social activities looks like wasting money ] . For example [ when I and my friends want to spend time with each other , we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people | Premise | Supports = spending money on social activities looks like wasting money ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students | Claim ] , but I think [ both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Ability to Relate Well to people Vs Studying Hard To agree or disagree the statement that as far as getting a successful job in the future concerned , good ability of relating to people is more crucial than studying hard in the univeirsity is a matter of balancing its pros and cons . However , if one coniders the issue carefully , he or she may agree the title statement as I do .

Target TANL: First of all , [ friends is a treasure with respect to either our daylife or our career | Premise | Supports = Relating well to people can bring plenty of merits to future job ] . [ Relating well to people can bring plenty of merits to future job | Claim ] . [ Having a good ability of relate to people means you have a number of friends in a variety of fields , imagine when you are in trouble , you have a lot of people who have good relationship with you , so you can ask for your friends to help you solve this problem as soon as possible , even an esy phone call , instend of a series of complex solutions | Premise | Supports = Relating well to people can bring plenty of merits to future job ] .

Target TANL: Futuermore , [ no matter who you are a top - level managers of a company or a low - level employee of that company , relating well to people is also a importent issue | Premise | Supports = make a good relationship with them ] . [ If top - level managers want to make a project successful , have a good relationship with their subordinaries is the prerequisit for the managers ' work complete successfully , managers should listen to their employees needs and complaints about this job , pay much patiant and care to them | Premise | Supports = make a good relationship with them ] . Consequently , [ make a good relationship with them | Claim ] .

Target TANL: On the other side , [ if a low - level employee desire to enhance his position , it ' s fairly important to have a good relationship with their boss | Claim ] , [ only if the employee is considered excellent in his boss ' s eyes , he will be more possible to enhance position | Premise | Supports = if a low - level employee desire to enhance his position , it ' s fairly important to have a good relationship with their boss ] .

Target TANL: However , someone may maintain that [ good specify knowledge is more crucial for future job | Claim ] . [ Studying harder in school , getting a good resume and absorbing lots of working knowledge , which can make these graduates more competitive than other applicants in one certain job | Premise | Supports = good specify knowledge is more crucial for future job ] . But imagine it , a person who is good at working knowledge but has an poorly relate to people , and a person who has a good ability of relating to people but his working knowledge is less better than the former , which person do you want to be ? I think [ majority of people would choose the former | Premise | Supports = good specify knowledge is more crucial for future job ] because [ it has more chance than the latter in terms of getting good jobs in the future | Premise | Supports = majority of people would choose the former ] .

Target TANL: In my point of view , [ I do really prefer to improve my ability of relating people and make more friends rather than studying hard in school | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: It is essential to have ability to plan and organize With the fast rolling wheels of modern society , life becomes more complex and is not easy to handle than in the past . Therefore , [ it is essential for people , especially young ones , to possess the ability to plan and organize | MajorClaim ] since [ it can improve the efficiency and reduce the crisis of our actions | Claim ] . Meanwhile , eliminating meaningless actions .

Target TANL: First of all , [ great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive | Claim ] . [ Take myself as an example , I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam , submitting my paper , and finishing my internship work at the end of each term | Premise | Supports = great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive ] . [ Yet , in this year , following the suggestion of my roommate , John , I make a to - do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control | Premise | Supports = great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive ] . [ This plan ability helps me a lot , making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else | Premise | Supports = great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive ] .

Target TANL: Equally important , [ the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions , which may ruin one ' s whole effort over a very long time | Claim ] . As we all know , [ the employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly | Premise | Supports = If some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead , they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent ] . [ If some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead , they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent | Premise | Supports = the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions , which may ruin one ' s whole effort over a very long time ] . However , things have been changing all the time . For instance , [ the deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company ' s schedule | Premise | Supports = those employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired ] . In this case , [ those employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired | Premise | Supports = the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions , which may ruin one ' s whole effort over a very long time ] . [ Every employee can not afford this kind of loss | Premise | Supports = the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions , which may ruin one ' s whole effort over a very long time ] .

Target TANL: Finally , some assert that [ the ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job | Premise | Supports = it is not need for young people to possess this ability ] . Thus , [ it is not need for young people to possess this ability | Claim ] . Nevertheless , [ this ability is also essential for young people | Premise | Attacks = it is not need for young people to possess this ability ] since [ young people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability | Premise | Supports = this ability is also essential for young people ] . [ As searching information on the internet , young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs | Premise | Supports = if they make their plan in the first place , and then stick to their plans , they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination ] . At this circumstances , [ they would surf on the internet for hours and end up no where | Premise | Supports = if they make their plan in the first place , and then stick to their plans , they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination ] . [ It is obviously a huge waste of time | Premise | Supports = if they make their plan in the first place , and then stick to their plans , they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination ] . But [ if they make their plan in the first place , and then stick to their plans , they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination | Premise | Attacks = it is not need for young people to possess this ability ] .

Target TANL: [ In this complex society , we , young people , are encompassed with multiple tasks | Claim ] , so [ the ability to plan and organize is undoubtedly a powerful and sharp weapon that we must be armed with | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Students should attend to classes or it should be optional ? Nowadays , it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities ( options ) as well . On the contrary to this popular belief , there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money . However , I am inclined to believe that [ being present at classes seems a wiser option | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First and foremost , I truly believe that [ being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college | Claim ] . Also , [ they can help each other for learning materials better | Premise | Supports = being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college ] . However , [ if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems | Premise | Supports = being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college ] .

Target TANL: Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that [ by the help of teachers , students can understand ideas faster and easier | Claim ] since [ teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points | Premise | Supports = by the help of teachers , students can understand ideas faster and easier ] . [ In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self - study | Premise | Supports = by the help of teachers , students can understand ideas faster and easier ] .

Target TANL: Finally yet importantly , [ appearing in class makes students more conscientious | Claim ] since [ they have to obey class’s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments | Premise | Supports = appearing in class makes students more conscientious ] . However , [ the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times | Premise | Supports = they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study ] . Through this way , [ they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study | Premise | Supports = appearing in class makes students more conscientious ] .

Target TANL: On the basis of the points mentioned above , I convinced that [ communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials | MajorClaim ] . Moreover , [ teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it | Claim ] . Also , [ attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Telephones and emails have made personal communication less required There are many advantage of these invention , telephones and email . [ Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier | Claim ] . [ I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication , telephones and email , made people less personal | MajorClaim ] . I will give several reasons to support my opinion .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ telephones and email help people , who live far away from other people , to connect each other | Claim ] . [ Unlike email , send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address | Premise | Supports = telephones and email help people , who live far away from other people , to connect each other ] . [ I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with | Premise | Supports = telephones and email help people , who live far away from other people , to connect each other ] . For example , right now , I am in the U . S . [ It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents , who live in my country | Premise | Supports = I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want ] . Consequently , [ I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want | Premise | Supports = Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents ] . [ Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents | Premise | Supports = telephones and email help people , who live far away from other people , to connect each other ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ using telephones and email could express some important words better than face - to - face communication | Claim ] . For instant , [ sometime when I argue with my friends , I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment | Premise | Supports = when I have a time to realize what had happened , I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion ] . So , [ when I have a time to realize what had happened , I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion | Premise | Supports = these types of communications make me feel personal ] . Thus , [ these types of communications make me feel personal | Premise | Supports = using telephones and email could express some important words better than face - to - face communication ] .

Target TANL: [ Telephones and email make me feel personal | Claim ] because [ I could directly connect with people that I love | Premise | Supports = Telephones and email make me feel personal ] . Beside , [ I could express my personal thought through telephones and email | Premise | Supports = Telephones and email make me feel personal ] . As a result , I believe that [ telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Big city vs small town [ I highly prefer living in a big city to living in countryside | MajorClaim ] . [ The big cities have lots of advantages and facilities over the small towns | Claim ] . [ Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life | Claim ] , because [ the environment that a person grow up , build the personality and his / her culture | Premise | Supports = Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life ] .

Target TANL: [ There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants , museums , bars , sporting clubs , cinemas , theatre and etc | Premise | Supports = People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends ] . [ People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers | Premise | Supports = persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns ] . It’s undisputed that [ in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life | Premise | Supports = persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns ] . [ Better education results better career and been well paid | Premise | Supports = persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns ] . So [ persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns | Claim ] . Also [ lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns | Premise | Supports = persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns ] .

Target TANL: But [ by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation | Claim ] , because [ distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly | Premise | Supports = by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation ] . [ Every technology has it’s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology | Premise | Attacks = by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation ] . In addition to what mentioned , [ medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , in my view [ living in big cities is quite funnier and better and more exciting than living in small towns because of many more social places , technologies facilities , better education and medical services | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Which do you prefer : do only what you already do well , or not . You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren ' t good at the things . That may help you expand experiences , look for your personalities and find your new talents . This ideal , however , doesn ' t necessarily be accomplished . If not , you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things . So , I definitely believe that [ you should focus on what you are good at | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal | Premise | Supports = you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well ] . Without doubt , [ the more time you spend on what you do well , the more likely to achieve something great you will be | Premise | Supports = you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well ] . For instance , [ Albert Einstein , one of the most competent physicians in history , devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity | Premise | Supports = the more time you spend on what you do well , the more likely to achieve something great you will be ] . Instead , [ he hardly cared about something else | Premise | Supports = the more time you spend on what you do well , the more likely to achieve something great you will be ] . [ It is said that , surprisingly , he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup | Premise | Supports = the more time you spend on what you do well , the more likely to achieve something great you will be ] because , at least for him , [ using two different soups properly was quite annoying | Premise | Supports = It is said that , surprisingly , he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup ] . As the example above indicates , [ you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ If you keep doing what you already do well , you can be better good at it | Premise | Supports = by doing what you are good at , you will be better at it ] . [ When you ' re doing something well , you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it | Premise | Supports = by doing what you are good at , you will be better at it ] . Then , [ you will motivate yourself to do more | Premise | Supports = by doing what you are good at , you will be better at it ] . To give an example , [ I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school | Premise | Supports = by doing what you are good at , you will be better at it ] . Because [ I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably | Premise | Supports = I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems ] , [ I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems | Premise | Supports = I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university - level problems ] . As a result , [ I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university - level problems | Premise | Supports = I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school ] . Thus , [ by doing what you are good at , you will be better at it | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In summary , [ doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: The internet provides a lot of valuable information In the modern society , internet is considered as one of the most important inventions over the past century . Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet . However , some say that [ the internet provides a lot of valuable information | MajorClaim ] . In my opinion , I agree with the latter because [ the internet gives daily necessary information , people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world | Claim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives | Claim ] . [ Sometimes , they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people | Premise | Supports = everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives ] .

Everything seem to be rush , and it have a lot of competition . These make people get stress . Thus , many people try to reduce their stress . There are many activities that could relieve those people who are in stress . in my opinion , [ reducing stress by listening to music , playing sports , and doing meditation are easy and practical ways | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ listening to music is a great way to relax | Claim ] . For example , when I go to office , I use public transport . I see many things such as traffic jam , crowded people at bus stop , and all so crowded people in buses . These make me stress . So that [ I always listen music from my mp3 player | Premise | Supports = listening to music is a great way to relax ] . [ I could enjoy listening music without thinking of people around me | Premise | Supports = I feel happy when I listen music ] . Consequently , [ I feel happy when I listen music | Premise | Supports = listening to music is a great way to relax ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ another way that is perfectly work for everyone to reduce the stress is exercise | Claim ] . For instance , I alway have many things in my mind such as a difficult of my work that I have to finish in time . These problem sometime make me hard to fall asleep because it make me stress . Thus , [ after work , I always do exercise , and jogging is my favorite sport | Premise | Supports = another way that is perfectly work for everyone to reduce the stress is exercise ] .

Target TANL: Should teachers be paid according to how much their students learn ? Everyone is different . Although students are in the same process of education system , learning abilities in each students are not equal . Some students are fast learner , but some students are not . Thus , [ paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate , and it is not fair for teacher | MajorClaim ] . So that , I disagree with this notion .

Target TANL: To begin with , in schools , [ main task of teacher to give knowledge to students , and this role have to finish in time | Premise | Supports = Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule ] . [ there are certain period of time for teachers to teach | Premise | Supports = Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule ] . [ In these short time , it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class | Premise | Supports = Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule ] . [ Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule | Claim ] . [ If teachers pay attention to specific students , their work might not finish on time , and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know | Premise | Supports = Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ learning abilities in each students is different | Premise | Supports = testing result are different ] . [ It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time | Premise | Supports = testing result are different ] . [ Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not | Premise | Supports = testing result are different ] . Therefore , [ testing result are different | Premise | Supports = teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get ] . [ This problems depend on how hard study they do | Premise | Supports = teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get ] . [ It is not teachers fault | Premise | Supports = teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get ] . Thus , [ teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Lastly , [ there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get | Premise | Supports = grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher ] . [ That is problem in quality of education | Premise | Supports = grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher ] . [ Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics | Premise | Supports = grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher ] . [ Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary | Premise | Supports = grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher ] . [ This problem should not be happened | Premise | Supports = grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher ] . Therefore , [ grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn | MajorClaim ] because [ teacher could not pay attention to each students in class | Claim ] . Besides , [ learning abilities of student are different | Claim ] . Moreover , [ there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Should good people are rewarded and bad people are punished in movies or dramas ? When we watch movies or dramas , some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished . While there are also some people who do not like this . Personally , I prefer to see good people get rewarded . However , [ if the good people always get an happy ending , I don’t think it’s proper | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First , [ if all the story end up in the same way , it will be boring | Premise | Supports = we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs ] . [ If good people always win , we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas | Premise | Supports = we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs ] . [ Then we will feel less interested in them | Premise | Supports = we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs ] . [ But if the good people are not always rewarded , we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story | Premise | Supports = we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs ] . For example , [ Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl | Premise | Supports = we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs ] . [ But now many people , including me , have been tired with it | Premise | Supports = we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs ] . [ I don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again | Premise | Supports = we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs ] . So [ we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ Even in the real world , good people can get a bad ending sometimes | Premise | Supports = if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded , they may think it will be true in the real world ] . And I think [ it happen more often in the real world than in those movies | Premise | Supports = if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded , they may think it will be true in the real world ] . So [ if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded , they may think it will be true in the real world | Claim ] . [ They will be misleading by those movies | Premise | Supports = if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded , they may think it will be true in the real world ] . And [ they may act like good people in order to get reward | Premise | Supports = if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded , they may think it will be true in the real world ] . [ Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded , they may feel upset and not to be a good person | Premise | Supports = if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded , they may think it will be true in the real world ] . But in fact , [ the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not | Premise | Supports = we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding ] . So [ we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding | Premise | Supports = if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded , they may think it will be true in the real world ] .

Target TANL: In fact , [ those good endings sometimes are helpful | Premise | Attacks = we should show people the truth in the stories ] . [ Some people may be encouraged to do good things | Premise | Supports = those good endings sometimes are helpful ] . But like I said , [ this kind of behavior won’t last long | Premise | Attacks = those good endings sometimes are helpful ] , because [ someday they will realize the truth | Premise | Supports = this kind of behavior won’t last long ] . So I suggest [ we should show people the truth in the stories | Claim ] . And [ if they can , they will be good people no matter how the story ends | Premise | Supports = we should show people the truth in the stories ] .

Target TANL: Based on my arguments above , I think [ movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Should replace normal classroom with online computer classes ? There are many advantages of distance learning , but [ it should not replace classroom learning | Claim ] . [ Learning in classroom could provide more information to study | Premise | Supports = it should not replace classroom learning ] . Besides , [ learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills , and learning how to solve problem in real situation | Premise | Supports = it should not replace classroom learning ] . Consequently , [ I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course | MajorClaim ] . I will give reasons to support my opinion .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt | Claim ] . Because [ in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example | Premise | Supports = learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt ] . For example , [ in biology class , learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits | Premise | Supports = learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt ] . [ Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog | Premise | Supports = learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt ] . Unlike classroom , [ online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation | Premise | Supports = learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ online class could not provide knowledge about social skills | Claim ] . For instance , [ In a classroom , teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group | Premise | Supports = online class could not provide knowledge about social skills ] . [ This could help students to learn how to deal with people , how to collaborate with people in their group | Premise | Supports = online class could not provide knowledge about social skills ] . [ This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes | Premise | Supports = online class could not provide knowledge about social skills ] .

Target TANL: Lastly , [ learning in classroom , student could have healthier life | Claim ] because [ in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body | Premise | Supports = learning in classroom , student could have healthier life ] . [ Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way | Premise | Supports = learning in classroom , student could have healthier life ] . [ If student do it by themselves , they might be hurt themselves | Premise | Supports = learning in classroom , student could have healthier life ] . [ This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide | Premise | Supports = learning in classroom , student could have healthier life ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class | MajorClaim ] . Because , [ classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject | Premise | Supports = having classroom could provide abundant skills to students ] . Besides , [ classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill | Premise | Supports = having classroom could provide abundant skills to students ] . Moreover , [ classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health | Premise | Supports = having classroom could provide abundant skills to students ] . Thus , [ having classroom could provide abundant skills to students | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Experiences that have shaped your outlook and the way you live [ Many circumstances that I experienced change the way I think | MajorClaim ] . [ There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way | Claim ] . For example , [ I could improve the way that I solve problems , improve how I take care of my health , and improve to plan my life for future | Premise | Supports = There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way ] . I will give reasons to support my opinion .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems | Claim ] . For example , [ in math class , the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step | Premise | Supports = studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems ] . [ Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem | Premise | Supports = studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems ] . [ I could adapt this method to use my real life | Premise | Supports = studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems ] . [ When I want to go to somewhere , I try to find the way to reach to destination | Premise | Supports = studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems ] . [ Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time | Premise | Supports = studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems ] . [ I could find a better way to solve problems | Premise | Supports = studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself | Claim ] . For instance , [ reading and listening the news about choosing a good diet are the way to keep myself are more healthy | Premise | Supports = I am always buy a quality food such as organic food ] . Thus , [ I am always buy a quality food such as organic food | Premise | Supports = Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself ] . [ This food are not have chemical | Premise | Supports = I can have a good health ] . So that , [ I can have a good health | Premise | Supports = Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself ] . [ This experience teach me to aware my health | Premise | Supports = Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself ] .

Target TANL: Lastly , [ experiences are also change to plan for my future life | Claim ] . For example , [ I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life | Premise | Supports = I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life ] .

Target TANL: One important thing that I want to change about my hometown Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place . However , it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements . In my hometown , there are almost complete public utilities for one’s needs but transportation . So [ the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation | MajorClaim ] . Since [ I’m facing the traffic congestion every day | Claim ] . And this problem seem to get worst .

Target TANL: At first , [ it should have more alternatives to use public transportation , such as a subway train or a sky train | Claim ] . Hence , [ people will have more ways to go to a place | Premise | Supports = it should have more alternatives to use public transportation , such as a subway train or a sky train ] . Since [ now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community | Premise | Supports = It makes people in this area have no choice ] , [ It makes people in this area have no choice | Premise | Supports = it should have more alternatives to use public transportation , such as a subway train or a sky train ] . [ They must take only a bus to go to another place | Premise | Supports = It makes people in this area have no choice ] . [ If a subway and a sky train are available here , it will be more convenience to them | Premise | Supports = it should have more alternatives to use public transportation , such as a subway train or a sky train ] . For example , [ people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule | Premise | Supports = If a subway and a sky train are available here , it will be more convenience to them ] . [ On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus | Premise | Supports = If a subway and a sky train are available here , it will be more convenience to them ] . Also , [ this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ the buses provide merely two routes in this community | Premise | Supports = They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily ] . [ It is absolutely a major problem | Premise | Supports = They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily ] . For example , [ if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses , I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus | Premise | Supports = it is waste of time ] . Obviously , [ it is waste of time | Premise | Supports = They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily ] . [ They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Lastly , [ having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars | Premise | Supports = The necessary energy will slowly be used up ] . Also , it provides many advantages . For instance , [ people can save their expenses form gasoline , which nowadays is getting more expensive | Premise | Supports = The necessary energy will slowly be used up ] . [ The necessary energy will slowly be used up | Claim ] , since [ people use less their own cars | Premise | Supports = The necessary energy will slowly be used up ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , [ the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people’s living | MajorClaim ] . I wish one day this problem would be changed . And then , the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community .

Target TANL: Some people prefer to work for a large company Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context , success and needs of their work . Small companies usually have a local job in the area , while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries . [ I personally prefer to work for a large company | MajorClaim ] for several reasons .

Target TANL: First , [ to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company | Claim ] . [ Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing , managing and selling their products in different countries | Premise | Supports = to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company ] . For example , [ if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country , they would need more employees in that country to work there | Premise | Supports = to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company ] . In other words , [ Large company equals more job opportunity | Premise | Supports = to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company ] .

Target TANL: Second , I think that [ a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one | Claim ] . [ The fact that a company is a large one , this means that it ' s having a considerable success | Premise | Supports = a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one ] . In other words , [ this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees | Premise | Supports = a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one ] . For instance , [ common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won ' t give the same salary as a small local company | Premise | Supports = a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one ] .

Target TANL: Third , I love travelling around the world . [ large companies have an international reputation , as they organize international conferences , meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people | Claim ] . [ As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops | Premise | Supports = large companies have an international reputation , as they organize international conferences , meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , i can certainly state that [ I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one | MajorClaim ] . [ I have different reasons to hold that , such as having a better chance to find work , having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Higher education should be available only to good students or not No one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone . College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal . There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university . This issue will be discussed .

Target TANL: First of all , many people think that [ college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students | Claim ] . The reason is that [ studying in advance education take a huge of money | Premise | Supports = college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students ] . [ College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time | Premise | Supports = college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students ] . They believe that [ only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students | Premise | Supports = college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students ] . Consequently , [ mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university | Premise | Supports = college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , there are some people think that [ all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education | Premise | Supports = mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university ] . Of course , [ higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time | Premise | Attacks = mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university ] however [ moderate students should have a chance to try | Premise | Attacks = higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time ] . [ Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change | Premise | Supports = moderate students should have a chance to try ] . [ With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future | Premise | Supports = mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university ] . Thus , [ mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I personally agree with that [ college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal | MajorClaim ] . [ Students can have opportunity to learn , to practice , to gain more knowledge for their career and for their future | Claim ] . [ Studying in college and university is a great opportunity that all students should have | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Disagree Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed ! It is a debatable subject that [ children should not be allowed to play computer games | MajorClaim ] since [ playing computer games is a a waste of time | Claim ] . I hold a positive view against this opinion .

Target TANL: First and foremost , [ a large number of students are obsessed in on - line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined | Claim ] . [ An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80 % of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on - online games every week , while 90 % excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days | Premise | Supports = a large number of students are obsessed in on - line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined ] . [ Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games , because of their low control ability | Premise | Supports = a large number of students are obsessed in on - line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ children could learn nothing from these computer games | Premise | Supports = time on this activity is really time wasting ] , therefore [ time on this activity is really time wasting | Claim ] . Since [ all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children | Premise | Supports = majority of the games use war , violence , bloody , or sexual subjects to lure the students ] , [ majority of the games use war , violence , bloody , or sexual subjects to lure the students | Premise | Supports = time on this activity is really time wasting ] . However , [ those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths | Premise | Supports = time on this activity is really time wasting ] .

Target TANL: Admittedly , [ there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career | Claim ] . But we have to realize the fact : [ majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying , sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games | Premise | Attacks = there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career ] . [ It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on - line games at public internet bar , and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar | Premise | Attacks = there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I believe [ it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games | MajorClaim ] . The computer games are like cigerate to adults and we need to set up rules to regulate this area .

Target TANL: Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e - mail When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email , I am of the view that [ wok in person is preferred | MajorClaim ] because [ this means help to achieve a good communication | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently | Premise | Supports = discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails ] . Obviously , [ discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails | Claim ] . [ An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity | Premise | Supports = discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails ] . [ The first group was asked to discuss in person , while the second group was asked to discuss by email | Premise | Supports = discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails ] . The result shows that [ the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget , while it takes 30 hours for the later one | Premise | Supports = discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails ] . [ The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other | Premise | Supports = discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project | Premise | Supports = less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights , and enhance the communication amongst the team members ] because [ there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members | Premise | Supports = work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project ] . [ Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official | Premise | Supports = people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing ] , therefore [ people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing | Premise | Supports = less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights , and enhance the communication amongst the team members ] . While [ if the same words are expressed in talking , the counterparty will feel more relaxed | Premise | Supports = less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights , and enhance the communication amongst the team members ] since [ their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim | Premise | Supports = if the same words are expressed in talking , the counterparty will feel more relaxed ] . Therefore , [ less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights , and enhance the communication amongst the team members | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Admittedly , [ sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place | Premise | Supports = emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none ] . Although [ emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none | Claim ] . Since [ it is a classroom or campus projects , there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas | Premise | Attacks = emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none ] .

Target TANL: While [ we should realize that in a project , there are numerous coordination works are required , if each opinion is communicated via email , there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience | Claim ] . In conclusion , [ I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email | MajorClaim ] because [ work in person will be more efficient | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Professors should do more research or teach students ? These days , more and more university professors are involved in scientific research . Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching . However , according to my experiences , [ professors should be encouraged to mainly do research | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ doing research is a method of self - improvement for professors | Premise | Supports = The research projects like windows opened to the wider world ] . [ Universities are relatively fenced environment | Premise | Supports = The research projects like windows opened to the wider world ] . [ The research projects provide communication with the outside | Premise | Supports = The research projects like windows opened to the wider world ] . In addition , [ by doing research , professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies | Premise | Supports = The research projects like windows opened to the wider world ] . [ I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college | Premise | Supports = The research projects like windows opened to the wider world ] . [ He was often invited to do speech in other universities | Premise | Supports = The research projects like windows opened to the wider world ] . Although [ my university is not in the high - ranking list , he gained a reputation by those projects | Premise | Supports = The research projects like windows opened to the wider world ] . [ The research projects like windows opened to the wider world | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ professors should fully use the research - friendly environment provided by universities | Claim ] . [ It is very common to see state - of - the - art laboratories in the campus | Premise | Supports = professors should fully use the research - friendly environment provided by universities ] . Also , [ you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together | Premise | Supports = there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages ] . Consequently , [ there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages | Premise | Supports = professors should fully use the research - friendly environment provided by universities ] . [ We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin | Premise | Supports = professors should fully use the research - friendly environment provided by universities ] . [ Universities positively contribute the professors ' success | Premise | Supports = professors should fully use the research - friendly environment provided by universities ] .

Target TANL: Last but not least , [ doing research could also improve the teaching quality | Claim ] . [ With the help of research projects , professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom | Premise | Supports = doing research could also improve the teaching quality ] . [ They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice | Premise | Supports = doing research could also improve the teaching quality ] . [ I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor ' s research project | Premise | Supports = doing research could also improve the teaching quality ] . [ By participating in it , I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments | Premise | Supports = doing research could also improve the teaching quality ] . [ The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching | Premise | Supports = doing research could also improve the teaching quality ] .

Target TANL: For those reasons , [ it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research | MajorClaim ] . [ While extending the way of their own development , the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself . Every person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them . As for the learning by yourself , it has some certain profit . It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you , and your learning becomes more profound . In addition , the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework , Nevertheless , [ I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , The distinguishing fact of the [ learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies | Claim ] . In other words , [ when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out , that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly | Premise | Supports = learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies ] . In addition , [ professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge , and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study | Premise | Supports = learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies ] . [ They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages | Premise | Supports = learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies ] . Hence [ I , in my class , often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem , and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher | Premise | Supports = learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , in my mind , [ the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself | Claim ] . [ We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself | Premise | Supports = the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself ] . Furthermore , [ the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction | Premise | Supports = the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself ] . Moreover , [ This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree | Premise | Supports = the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself ] . [ knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened | Premise | Supports = the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself ] .

Target TANL: Finally , of course , [ being without a teacher has shortcomings | Claim ] . Notable one of the shortcomings is that [ if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried , this might be ended in disappointment | Premise | Supports = being without a teacher has shortcomings ] . I think that [ for one who depends on only himself in learning , his improvement of ability , with regard to cooperation and express his opinion , is unpromising | Premise | Supports = being without a teacher has shortcomings ] . Hence [ I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Technology designed to make people ' s lives simpler often make them more complicated Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology . With newly developing technologies , people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy . For example , we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver ' s license or drive to bank for sending money . Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians . However , even with all the conveniences , we would have to admit that [ technologies made our lives more complicated | MajorClaim ] . There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer .

Target TANL: Of course , [ new technologies are always great | Claim ] . However , [ it takes time for people to adapt them | Premise | Attacks = new technologies are always great ] . Since [ we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day | Premise | Supports = many people often get lost ] , [ many people often get lost | Premise | Attacks = new technologies are always great ] . For instance , [ I use new Iphone which I personally think is great | Premise | Supports = even though I used it for couple months , I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently ] . However , [ even though I used it for couple months , I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently | Premise | Attacks = new technologies are always great ] . At first , [ I tried to go through all the instructions but , soon , I gave up | Premise | Supports = even though I used it for couple months , I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently ] because [ I found out that it is time - consuming and there are too many things to learn | Premise | Supports = I tried to go through all the instructions but , soon , I gave up ] .

Target TANL: Next , [ technology destroys the language | Claim ] . Ever since [ people used computers or cellphones to chat with others | Premise | Supports = they created their own language to communicate ] , [ they created their own language to communicate | Premise | Supports = technology destroys the language ] . Because [ people try to type as fast as they are talking | Premise | Supports = they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language ] , [ they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language | Premise | Supports = technology destroys the language ] . [ This has gotten worse with twitter , myspace , and facebook | Premise | Supports = technology destroys the language ] . [ What are even worse , young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions | Premise | Supports = technology destroys the language ] . To clarify , [ my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of | Premise | Supports = technology destroys the language ] . [ I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative | Premise | Supports = technology destroys the language ] .

Target TANL: Although [ technologies allowed us to have a convenient life | Claim ] , [ it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Classroom learnng vs online education There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion . As far as I am concerned , I strongly believe that [ online classes should never replace classroom learning | MajorClaim ] . I list my reasons as follows .

Target TANL: First , indeed [ classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes | Claim ] . [ In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates | Premise | Supports = classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes ] , because [ if you see any of your classmates who is performing better , it will force you for making your performance more better | Premise | Supports = In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates ] . For example , [ When I was in First Year in B Com , I was not serious in my study , but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me , it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects | Premise | Supports = classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes ] . Finally [ I got 1st rank in final exam | Premise | Supports = classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time | Premise | Supports = It makes you perfect in time management skills ] . [ It makes you perfect in time management skills | Claim ] . Moreover [ you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others | Premise | Supports = It makes you perfect in time management skills ] . [ It makes you communication and of course your group skills better , which can help you in your future and career | Premise | Supports = It makes you perfect in time management skills ] .

Target TANL: Third , [ professors play vital role in classroom learning , most of them are specialists is their subjects , and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills | Premise | Supports = you learn quickly ] . [ You can improve your skills by work under any professor ; you can ask questions face to face , it will clear your doubts | Premise | Supports = you learn quickly ] . In result [ you learn quickly | Claim ] . For example , I have my personal experience . [ For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses , but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT , and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster | Premise | Supports = you learn quickly ] .

Target TANL: It ' s undeniable that [ online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary | Claim ] , but [ they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning | Premise | Attacks = online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary ] .

Target TANL: From the discussed above , we can easily draw the conclusion that [ the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Part time job for teenage students When we talk about student , we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college . In some country , teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study . However , some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study . In my view , [ it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he / she is still a student | MajorClaim ] and this is for two reasons .

Target TANL: The main reason is that [ students can learn lots of things from part time job , before starting their real job | Claim ] . [ Students can learn about time management , money management and convince people by their words | Premise | Supports = students can learn lots of things from part time job , before starting their real job ] . For example , [ when I was in my high school I worked as a sales - man in a shop for a year | Premise | Supports = students can learn lots of things from part time job , before starting their real job ] . [ As i had to spend some of my time in my job | Premise | Supports = i had to manage my time efficiently ] , therefore , [ i had to manage my time efficiently | Premise | Supports = when I was in my high school I worked as a sales - man in a shop for a year ] . [ I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework | Premise | Supports = when I was in my high school I worked as a sales - man in a shop for a year ] . [ This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively | Premise | Supports = i had to manage my time efficiently ] . Moreover , [ I learn money management | Premise | Supports = when I was in my high school I worked as a sales - man in a shop for a year ] . [ When my boss was out of the shop , i had to manage the accounts section of the shop | Premise | Supports = I learn money management ] . [ From this i learned , how to manage money correctly | Premise | Supports = when I was in my high school I worked as a sales - man in a shop for a year ] . [ This experience taught me , doing part time job can help students to learn many things | Premise | Supports = when I was in my high school I worked as a sales - man in a shop for a year ] .

Target TANL: Another reason is that [ from part time jobs students can earn money , which can help their parents | Claim ] . For instance , when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor . I taught math to two kids of my neighbor . I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books . [ By tutoring them , i earned some money and bought me books with it | Premise | Supports = from part time jobs students can earn money , which can help their parents ] . Moreover , [ after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents | Premise | Supports = from part time jobs students can earn money , which can help their parents ] . As you can see , [ part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially | Premise | Supports = from part time jobs students can earn money , which can help their parents ] .

Target TANL: In sum , I am sure ; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students . They will argue , [ it can destruct students from their study | Claim ] . However , as [ i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result | Premise | Attacks = it can destruct students from their study ] ; therefore , i believe [ part time job will be good for students | MajorClaim ] . Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future .

Target TANL: Which is better - Learning foreign language in home or host country ? Our World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language . It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill - set as well . Also , I think [ its better that people learn foreign language in their own country | MajorClaim ] . The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs .

Target TANL: First of all , [ it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language | Claim ] as [ it requires large amount of money and legal formalities | Premise | Supports = it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language ] . [ In the earlier periods , it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge | Premise | Attacks = with the advent of globalization , one can easily find a teacher in their own country ] . But [ with the advent of globalization , one can easily find a teacher in their own country | Claim ] . For example , [ in Indian sub - continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french , german etc | Premise | Supports = with the advent of globalization , one can easily find a teacher in their own country ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum | Premise | Supports = it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country ] . [ Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university | Premise | Supports = it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country ] . So , [ it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country | Claim ] . Also , [ highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges | Premise | Supports = it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country ] .

Target TANL: Third , [ technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country | Claim ] . [ A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages | Premise | Supports = technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , [ it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country | MajorClaim ] . [ It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same | Claim ] .

Target TANL: One long vacation or several long vacation Everybody require some break from their tight schedules likewise students also require vacation form their intense academic schedules . Many people promote one long vacation system of the school because it would help student to start their course or academic year with strong zeal of learning . So other several , prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically . In both the scenario students relief themselves . However , [ i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low | Claim ] . [ Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student ' s get relief form exam pressure | Premise | Supports = several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low ] . However , [ research done by universities proves that student ' s performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning , preparation and examination schedule | Premise | Supports = several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low ] . [ Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester | Premise | Supports = several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low ] . Also [ several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course | Premise | Supports = several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students ' performance after break . It states that [ students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation | Claim ] . To quote an instance , [ in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams | Premise | Supports = students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation ] . [ During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes | Premise | Supports = students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation ] . [ I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game | Premise | Supports = students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation ] . [ During my all vacations , I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter | Premise | Supports = students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation ] .

Target TANL: [ Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers | Claim ] . As [ it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves , heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule | Premise | Supports = Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers ] . Therefore [ schools should consider giving several small vocations to the students during the year | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Saving / Spending money In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses . But isn ' t it better to save your money for later investments or rough times ? Im my opinion , [ saving some part of your earnings is essential | MajorClaim ] due to the fact that [ you can not predict future developments , neither in your professional nor your personal life , furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams | Claim ] .

Target TANL: First , [ there are several uncertainties about your professional future | Premise | Supports = The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account ] . [ The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account | Claim ] . As example [ I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe | Premise | Supports = The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account ] . Some of them had no own savings . [ They could not afford the rent | Premise | Supports = they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence ] , so [ they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence | Premise | Supports = The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account ] .

Target TANL: In addition , [ you can not be sure about the development in your personal life | Premise | Supports = It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings ] . [ It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings | Claim ] . [ Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car | Premise | Supports = It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings ] . [ He could not afford the maintenance | Premise | Supports = he had to sell it ] so [ he had to sell it | Premise | Supports = It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings ] .

Target TANL: Finally , [ with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams | Premise | Supports = Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished ] . [ Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished | Claim ] . For instance , [ I made a month - long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend | Premise | Supports = Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished ] . [ Without our savings we could not have pursued our long - time dream | Premise | Supports = Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished ] .

Target TANL: Considering all the above mentioned arguments , from my point of view [ there is no other choice than saving money for some time | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Rush vs Slower Pace Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously . However , while the majority of people live on the fast lane , others decide to reduce the speed and take their time . To draw an entire picture , we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better . In my opinion , [ it is very important to live life at a slower pace | MajorClaim ] , because [ living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages | Claim ] .

Target TANL: First , [ living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health | Claim ] . [ If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off , your body will react to your stressful lifestyle | Premise | Supports = living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health ] . [ Many hardworking people have diseases , like the burn - out syndrome | Premise | Supports = living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health ] , because [ their bodies cannot hold the pace | Premise | Supports = Many hardworking people have diseases , like the burn - out syndrome ] . For instance , [ my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job | Premise | Supports = living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health ] . [ After several weeks off his body was restored , now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine | Premise | Supports = living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health ] .

Target TANL: In addition , [ living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness | Claim ] .

[ If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends | Premise | Supports = living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness ] . [ Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level | Premise | Supports = living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness ] . For example , [ a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it | Premise | Supports = living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness ] , because [ he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships | Premise | Supports = a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it ] .

Target TANL: Finally , [ quality takes time | Premise | Supports = you might make mistakes , you would not have done with more patience ] . [ When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush , you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes | Premise | Supports = you might make mistakes , you would not have done with more patience ] . [ Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities | Premise | Supports = you might make mistakes , you would not have done with more patience ] . As a result [ you might make mistakes , you would not have done with more patience | Claim ] . To illustrate , [ I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade | Premise | Supports = you might make mistakes , you would not have done with more patience ] , because [ I made few mistakes I could have avoided | Premise | Supports = I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , there is to say that , given the arguments above , [ living a slower life is advantageous for your health , your happiness and even the quality of your work | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Human needs vs saving land for endangered animals In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now , for the first time in history , is exceeding seven billion . As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing , feeding and industry . But isn ' t it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet ? In my opinion , [ we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment | MajorClaim ] because of several reasons .

Target TANL: First , [ the natural diversity is very important for further generations | Claim ] . [ If we don ' t change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet | Premise | Supports = the natural diversity is very important for further generations ] . [ As we destroy the natural habitat , like forests , jungles and lakes , to make place for our industry and farmland , we rob the ecosystem | Premise | Supports = the natural diversity is very important for further generations ] . To illustrate , [ every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland | Premise | Supports = If we don ' t preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct ] . [ If we don ' t preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct | Premise | Supports = further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals ] . As a result , [ further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals | Premise | Supports = the natural diversity is very important for further generations ] .

Target TANL: In addition , [ a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather | Claim ] . [ Our behavior causes pollution , which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming | Premise | Supports = a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather ] . [ This not only affects the endangered animals , but also the humans | Premise | Supports = a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather ] because [ we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes | Premise | Supports = This not only affects the endangered animals , but also the humans ] . For example , [ recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that , till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average | Premise | Supports = a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather ] . [ This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate | Premise | Supports = a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , there is to say that , given the arguments above , [ we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment , not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Going to classes should be optional for the students University students have different opinion about their attendance to class . Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students . According to my opinion , because [ it is university level of education , students have enough maturity to choose their choice | Claim ] . Therefore , I strongly agree that [ going to classes should be optional for the students | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ going to classes are sometimes waste of the time | Claim ] . For instance , [ some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module | Premise | Supports = going to classes are sometimes waste of the time ] . Further , [ they didn ' t explain the contents in order to understand by the students | Premise | Supports = going to classes are sometimes waste of the time ] . [ It was waste of the time | Premise | Supports = going to classes are sometimes waste of the time ] . Because [ the university students have grown up | Premise | Supports = they have enough ability to read and understand the text book ] , [ they have enough ability to read and understand the text book | Claim ] . Moreover , [ with the modern technology , students can collect more information from different sources | Claim ] . For example , [ from the Internet , students can read many articles and e - books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently | Premise | Supports = with the modern technology , students can collect more information from different sources ] . However , [ some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way | Claim ] . [ When the students attend that lectures , they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time | Premise | Supports = some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way ] .

Target TANL: Additionally , [ mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures | Premise | Supports = they have to schedule the lectures time , studying time and working time ] . Besides , [ most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time | Premise | Supports = they have to schedule the lectures time , studying time and working time ] . [ Students need to work as part time basis | Premise | Supports = they have to schedule the lectures time , studying time and working time ] . Hence , [ they have to schedule the lectures time , studying time and working time | Claim ] . At the same time , [ rather than attending any boring lecturers , students can participate to other activities such as debate competition , swimming meet , Basketball and so forth | Claim ] . From that [ they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them | Premise | Supports = rather than attending any boring lecturers , students can participate to other activities such as debate competition , swimming meet , Basketball and so forth ] .

Target TANL: In a nutshell , although [ few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures | Claim ] , [ some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students ' time | Premise | Attacks = few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures ] . [ When the students go to university , they have matured mentally and physically | Claim ] . [ They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do | Claim ] . Therefore , to make use of time , [ if the students choose the classes as optional , it would provide more benefits than drawbacks | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Famous people are bothered by the media Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs . Others believe that television , newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well . This issue is a controversial one , but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that [ mass media deal too much with superficial things | MajorClaim ] for different reasons .

Target TANL: One reason is that [ television and newspapers focus on famous peoples ' lives in order to increase their audience or readership | Claim ] . [ Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs | Premise | Supports = television and newspapers focus on famous peoples ' lives in order to increase their audience or readership ] . [ Thanks to the Internet , we can go online and have access to information from all over the world | Premise | Supports = mass media don ' t need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience ] and therefore [ mass media don ' t need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience | Premise | Supports = television and newspapers focus on famous peoples ' lives in order to increase their audience or readership ] .

Target TANL: Another reason is that [ we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip | Claim ] . [ Nowadays , unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training | Premise | Supports = we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip ] . [ Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism ; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos | Premise | Supports = we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip ] . Additionally , [ there are Reality TV , television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations , for example like " Big Brother " | Premise | Supports = we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , it is clear that [ television , magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples ' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above , namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Dormitory or apartment ? When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school , most students always get confused between these two options : living in an apartment , or in university dormitories . As far as I am concerned , [ both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: On the one hand , [ living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university | Premise | Supports = living in dormitory is always helpful to students ] . For instance , [ students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club , or joining sports club | Premise | Supports = living in dormitory is always helpful to students ] . [ Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates | Premise | Supports = living in dormitory is always helpful to students ] . In addition , [ it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question , they can easily ask for help to their roommates , classmates , or teachers | Premise | Supports = living in dormitory is always helpful to students ] . I think [ living in dormitory is always helpful to students | Claim ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ living off campus prepares students for the real life | Claim ] . For example , [ students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible , independent , punctual , co - operative compared to living in university dormitories | Premise | Supports = living off campus prepares students for the real life ] . [ They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time , and dealing with the utility bills | Premise | Supports = living off campus prepares students for the real life ] . In addition , [ students also have to focus on their study , and try to maintain their grades higher | Premise | Supports = living off campus prepares students for the real life ] . Furthermore , [ students also have a chance to know about the community around them | Premise | Supports = living off campus prepares students for the real life ] . [ Interacting with the people , and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation | Premise | Supports = living off campus prepares students for the real life ] .

Target TANL: From given the evidences , it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since [ both living accommodation have its own benefits | MajorClaim ] . If I have to choose , [ I would definitely choose the second option : living in an apartment | MajorClaim ] . I think that [ it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life | Claim ] because [ learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life | Premise | Supports = it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life ] .

Target TANL: It is not necessary for university students to attend classes Though out the last decade , the load of the university students has been constantly increasing . There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam . There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam . However , from my perspective , [ students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam | MajorClaim ] . The reasons to be illustrated are follows .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject | Claim ] . For example , I love Physics . But [ I don ' t like electronics | Premise | Supports = the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject ] , because [ electronics cannot always be seen in the real world | Premise | Supports = I don ' t like electronics ] . [ And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics | Premise | Supports = the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject ] . [ But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics | Premise | Supports = the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject ] . [ And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics , I could not pass the entire part of physics , and I will fail the exam over and over again | Premise | Supports = the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject ] . [ Luckily , in our university , you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach | Premise | Supports = the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject ] . [ And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics | Premise | Supports = the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject ] . [ And at last , I took the electronics again and pass the exam | Premise | Supports = the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam , students are highly likely to leave uncultivated | Claim ] . [ If one fail most of the exam , it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes | Premise | Supports = if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam , students are highly likely to leave uncultivated ] . [ And the students will have nothing to do in the campus | Premise | Supports = if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam , students are highly likely to leave uncultivated ] . Then [ he or she will play online games days and nights | Premise | Supports = if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam , students are highly likely to leave uncultivated ] . [ The academic achievement will decline | Premise | Supports = if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam , students are highly likely to leave uncultivated ] . In the end , [ this student will become a loser in the world | Premise | Supports = if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam , students are highly likely to leave uncultivated ] . [ And all this is due to that the university don ' t permit them to attend the class | Premise | Supports = if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam , students are highly likely to leave uncultivated ] . [ This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system | Premise | Supports = if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam , students are highly likely to leave uncultivated ] .

Target TANL: Admittedly , [ the university student may don ' t reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not | Claim ] . But [ the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points | Premise | Attacks = the university student may don ' t reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not ] .

Target TANL: All in all , [ the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test | MajorClaim ] because [ not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Our useful friends Pets have always been essential in our society . Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds , tortoises and fishes as well . Some people think that pets should be treated like family members . However , others argue that they are just animals and aren ' t able to think like us . The issue is controversial but in my opinion , [ pets should be treated like human beings | MajorClaim ] for different reasons .

Target TANL: First , [ pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are | Claim ] . [ Similarly to friends , indeed , they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone | Premise | Supports = pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are ] . [ We can talk to them | Premise | Supports = pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are ] because [ they listen to us , more than some people will ever do | Premise | Supports = We can talk to them ] . To illustrate this point , I can write about my own experience . [ When I was 14 years old , my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important | Premise | Supports = they listen to us , more than some people will ever do ] . [ Talking to my friends was frustrating | Premise | Supports = they listen to us , more than some people will ever do ] because [ none of them have ever felt that way | Premise | Supports = Talking to my friends was frustrating ] . Since [ I was all alone at home for a long time | Premise | Supports = my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings ] , [ my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings | Premise | Supports = they listen to us , more than some people will ever do ] . Clearly , although [ pets aren ' t able to speak with us | Premise | Attacks = they listen to us , more than some people will ever do ] , [ we can nonetheless count on them | Premise | Attacks = pets aren ' t able to speak with us ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ pets are useful for a variety of things | Claim ] . For example , [ nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before | Premise | Supports = pets are useful for a variety of things ] . [ Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses | Premise | Supports = pets are useful for a variety of things ] . [ There are dogs who lead blind people around the city | Premise | Supports = without them they could not go around all alone ] and therefore [ without them they could not go around all alone | Premise | Supports = pets are useful for a variety of things ] . In addition , [ pets are important for depressed people as well | Premise | Supports = pets are useful for a variety of things ] because [ their presence make them feel better | Premise | Supports = pets are important for depressed people as well ] . Moreover , [ there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs | Premise | Supports = pets are useful for a variety of things ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , I am strongly convinced that [ pets deserve to be treated like family members | MajorClaim ] because of all the reasons mentioned above , namely [ they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Extraordinarily cautious is important since rough work is intolerable This current world we situate ourselves in is rather unpredictable , even one sudden invention could bring down all the notions we used bear in mind . Most of us has endeavored to keep up with the pace of the development of today ' s world in fast pace . I personally believe that even when [ fast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today ' s world | Claim ] . However , [ it might not be the most beneficial move to our society | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Primarily , [ even when the world operates in fast pace , it still requires accuracy | Claim ] . [ Even simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy | Premise | Supports = even when the world operates in fast pace , it still requires accuracy ] . [ If we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes , we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline | Premise | Supports = even when the world operates in fast pace , it still requires accuracy ] . In short , [ it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless | Premise | Supports = even when the world operates in fast pace , it still requires accuracy ] . [ It is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it | Premise | Supports = even when the world operates in fast pace , it still requires accuracy ] . Certainly [ it may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times | Premise | Attacks = even when the world operates in fast pace , it still requires accuracy ] , but [ with consistent work soon enough we ' ll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work | Premise | Attacks = it may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ other than the importance of accuracy , the world also seeks efficiency , which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality | Premise | Supports = Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project , this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients ] . [ Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project , this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients | Claim ] . [ We soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace | Premise | Supports = Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project , this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients ] since [ when the problem reveals itself we ' ll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made | Premise | Supports = We soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace ] . [ This might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start | Premise | Supports = when the problem reveals itself we ' ll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made ] .

Target TANL: Besides , when looking at this problem within a broader image . [ Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all | Claim ] , for instance , [ in official missions like the work done by NASA , a tiny mistake can be catastrophic | Premise | Supports = Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all ] . [ A miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars | Premise | Supports = in official missions like the work done by NASA , a tiny mistake can be catastrophic ] . In such circumstances , [ even when the scientists want to finish off quickly , but they couldn ' t miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems | Premise | Supports = in official missions like the work done by NASA , a tiny mistake can be catastrophic ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , even when [ we need to catch up with the pace of the world | Claim ] , [ it is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious | MajorClaim ] since [ rough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Living in big cities or living in small towns Continuous technological and economical development in modern world created great differences between cities , a difference that is clearly visible in the size of various cities . From cities with more that 20 million people to small towns inhabited by only hundreds of people . This diversities in cities allowed for more difference in people ' s preferences for where to live . For me , [ I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones | MajorClaim ] , this personal attitude is the result of many factors .

Target TANL: First of all , I find the excitement of big cities to be attractive , [ living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one ' s personality and open one ' s eyes on the real world | Claim ] . [ Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day , let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for | Premise | Supports = living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one ' s personality and open one ' s eyes on the real world ] . [ For me , this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant , slow paced life styles of small towns | Premise | Supports = living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one ' s personality and open one ' s eyes on the real world ] .

Target TANL: Another thing that put big cities in front of small towns is [ the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants ' lives , hospitals , advanced medical facilities can satisfy one ' s need of medical safety | Claim ] . [ Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one ' s and widen his horizons , things which aren ' t offered by small towns | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , it ' s undeniable that the [ economic power of a country is driven by it ' s big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities | Premise | Supports = big cities offer more opportunities for one ' s career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does ] . With this kind of power [ big cities offer more opportunities for one ' s career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does | Claim ] , and [ higher income can be the basis of a happier , healthier life | Premise | Supports = big cities offer more opportunities for one ' s career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does ] .

Target TANL: Finally , although [ I prefer to live in a big city | MajorClaim ] , I can not help but assure that this is a matter of personal taste , to be clear , [ I would love to spend some days in countryside to recharge my soul and relieve myself from daily stress | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Every experience always gives us something to learn and keep for life I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future . My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough [ experience makes us more skilled , improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood . [ Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking | Premise | Supports = those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life ] , eating , etc . , but [ those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life | Claim ] . For example , [ when they tried to learn walking , they stumble and hurt themselves many times | Premise | Supports = those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life ] . But [ they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk | Premise | Supports = those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life ] .

Target TANL: [ All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations | Claim ] . [ No known scientist has success in first attempt | Premise | Supports = All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations ] . [ Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want | Premise | Supports = All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations ] . It was said that [ Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb | Premise | Supports = all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through ] . So , [ all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through | Premise | Supports = All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations ] .

Target TANL: [ Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly | Claim ] . [ We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time , but when we think back about those moments later in life , we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves | Premise | Supports = Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly ] . [ When I moved to college hostel after school , first few days were very unsettling for me | Premise | Supports = Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly ] because [ first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known | Premise | Supports = When I moved to college hostel after school , first few days were very unsettling for me ] . [ I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted , but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them | Premise | Supports = Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly ] . [ I also became more casual and social with others , this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills | Premise | Supports = Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly ] .

Target TANL: Therefore , to conclude my opinion on this statement , I want to mentioned that [ every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life | MajorClaim ] . [ Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Drivers have to pay a fee for driving in Rush Hour Started in the late eighteenth century , the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles . The very fuel that they rely on , oil , has now become the dominant pollution of cities ' environment . While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts , I hold the contention that [ no additional payment should be charged on them | MajorClaim ] . The reasons are the followings .

Target TANL: [ Capitalism enfranchised people ' s right to own properties , and consequently , their rights to use them | Premise | Supports = charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction ] . [ Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities ' s environment , but laws protect drivers to do so | Premise | Supports = charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction ] , and accordingly , [ charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction | Claim ] . From another point of view , [ traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban | Premise | Supports = it is out of drivers ' control ] ; so [ it is out of drivers ' control | Premise | Supports = charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction ] . Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time ? [ Wars are notorious , but you can ' t blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries | Premise | Supports = charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction ] .

Target TANL: [ Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand ; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several - these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear | Premise | Supports = charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights ] . [ Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous | Claim ] . [ Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance | Premise | Supports = charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights ] , and [ charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights | Premise | Supports = Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous ] .

Target TANL: [ Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee , government should instead , be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental - friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil | Claim ] . [ Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light , or unreasonable organization of roadways | Premise | Supports = charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful ] . In these cases , [ the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner , not drivers | Premise | Supports = charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful ] . Simply put , [ charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ " rush hours " are usually not the direct consequence of drivers | Claim ] . Instead , the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds , and therefore , [ charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: The part - time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it Nowadays , the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger . If students want to get used to the society quickly , [ it is better for parents to encourage them to take part - time jobs | MajorClaim ] . There are some reasons can support my view .

Target TANL: First , [ there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university | Premise | Supports = they can teach students many things about adult life ] . Because [ most people they contact with are also students | Premise | Supports = there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university ] . However , [ when students do part - time jobs , they can work with many kinds of people , and most of whom are adults | Premise | Supports = they can teach students many things about adult life ] . So , [ they can teach students many things about adult life | Claim ] . [ My friend Lisa , who is doing part - time job now , tells me that it is fabulous to take it | Premise | Supports = they can teach students many things about adult life ] . [ Through part - time job , she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life | Premise | Supports = they can teach students many things about adult life ] . For example , [ Lisa thought in adult life , work is the core ; but after she knows these friends , she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work | Premise | Supports = thanks to the information her new friends has provided ; now she is more confidence about her future adult life ] . Hence , [ thanks to the information her new friends has provided ; now she is more confidence about her future adult life | Premise | Supports = they can teach students many things about adult life ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life | Premise | Supports = we need part - time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be ] . However , because [ we do not experience it | Premise | Supports = it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be ] , [ it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be | Premise | Supports = we need part - time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be ] . Therefore , [ we need part - time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be | Claim ] . Actually , [ some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part - time jobs , they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly ; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part - time job | Premise | Supports = the part - time job can make people understand future life better ] . Therefore , [ the part - time job can make people understand future life better | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Third , some parents are afraid that [ the part - time job will effect student ' study | Claim ] . Actually , [ most students will do the part - time job in their holiday | Premise | Supports = it will not effect on their study ] , so [ it will not effect on their study | Premise | Attacks = the part - time job will effect student ' study ] . [ Compared with playing computers every day , doing part - time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday | Premise | Supports = it will not effect on their study ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ taking the part - time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it | Claim ] . Therefore , [ parents should encourage students to take the part - time job | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Type of temper and advantages of individual work as best arguments in favor of studying alone Study achievements depend on a range of various factors , one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying . In particular , we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone . As for me , I favor the latter because of the following reasons .

Target TANL: To begin with , type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one . [ Being by nature introvert , I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people | Premise | Supports = my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper ] . [ Once , when I was working on presentation with strangers , I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people | Premise | Supports = my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper ] . Therefore , [ my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore / moreover , [ working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork | Claim ] . In other words , [ I must not divide tasks and duties between team members , share responsibility and benefits , and spend time on teambuilding | Premise | Supports = working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork ] . [ These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time | Premise | Supports = working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork ] . [ About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game | Premise | Supports = working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork ] . [ To my rivals ' surprise , being the only member of my own " team " I gained a victory | Premise | Supports = working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , from my point of view , [ type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Work for themselves vs work for employer Most people want to work for an employer , because they want to feel secure about their salary , or feel comfortable about other problems of having own job such as paying tax , worrying about selling , etc . Despite these problems , personally , [ I would prefer to have my own job | MajorClaim ] . My arguments are listed as follows .

Target TANL: First , [ time is the more valuable thing , which I have in my life | Claim ] . [ By having my own business , I can manage my own time | Premise | Supports = time is the more valuable thing , which I have in my life ] . I [ could work whenever I want , or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay | Premise | Supports = time is the more valuable thing , which I have in my life ] . [ I can arrange time to travel when I would like | Premise | Supports = time is the more valuable thing , which I have in my life ] . In addition , [ I can work long hours for earning more money | Premise | Supports = time is the more valuable thing , which I have in my life ] . Totally , [ the most important reason for me to be self - employed is the sense of free | Premise | Supports = time is the more valuable thing , which I have in my life ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , [ earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work | Premise | Supports = I never have been rich in my life ] . [ The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job | Premise | Supports = I never have been rich in my life ] . [ If I work for other people , I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply | Premise | Supports = I never have been rich in my life ] . Therefore , [ I never have been rich in my life | Claim ] , because [ my salary is not dramatically changed | Premise | Supports = I never have been rich in my life ] . In spite of many problems of having own business , [ I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas | Premise | Supports = I never have been rich in my life ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , in spite of the fact that [ many people are not eager to work for themselves | Claim ] , [ I would like to run my own business to control my own time , and to earn more money based on my noble ideas | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives . Getting the best lessons , besides our abilities to self - study , depends on our teachers a lot . There are people who believe that [ no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers | MajorClaim ] . I whole - heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life | Claim ] . [ As we were born , parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile , how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating | Premise | Supports = parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life ] . Moreover , [ when we grow bigger , they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives | Premise | Supports = parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life ] .

Target TANL: [ Living on your own is a huge financial commitment | Premise | Supports = living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income ] .

[ It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs | Premise | Supports = young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own ] . Thus , [ to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life , to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path , it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Technology impact on people Nowadays , the Earth has become like a small village .

For another , [ using machines can save company ' s money | Premise | Supports = machines can bring many benefits ] . Because [ machines never ask for salary , over - time pay or pension | Premise | Supports = employers do not need to spend money on employee ' s welfare ] , so [ employers do not need to spend money on employee ' s welfare | Premise | Supports = using machines can save company ' s money ] . [ The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working | Premise | Supports = using machines can save company ' s money ] .

But [ they did not know that compared with hand washing dish - washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware | Premise | Supports = nowadays people prefer to use dish - washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing ] .

For instance , [ many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot , which many lead to increased aggressive feelings , thoughts and behaviours | Premise | Supports = the hardship of communication may be developed ] . Therefore , [ the hardship of communication may be developed | Claim ] .

Target TANL: However , other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint . [ With rapid development of the internet , people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet | Premise | Supports = mobile phones have shortened the distance of communicatio ] . For instance , [ as lots of chatting apps available online such as " Weichat " , people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication | Premise | Supports = mobile phones have shortened the distance of communicatio ] . Therefore , [ mobile phones have shortened the distance of communicatio | Claim ]n .

Target TANL: After having considered all the problems that I have discussed above , we can finally draw a conclusion that although [ mobile phones brings convenience of communication | Claim ] , [ they also contribute to some social problems | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Mentioned to societies life style , [ they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had | Premise | Supports = there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook , also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time ] . Obviousness , [ there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook , also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Another perspective , [ using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable | Premise | Supports = some people become geek , as too much of using email and messaging , without direct contacts ] . [ It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere | Premise | Supports = they do not do much social live interactions with others ] , so [ they do not do much social live interactions with others | Premise | Supports = some people become geek , as too much of using email and messaging , without direct contacts ] . The consequence of this case made [ some people become geek , as too much of using email and messaging , without direct contacts | Claim ] . However , [ people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship , meet them and talk by face to face directly | Premise | Attacks = some people become geek , as too much of using email and messaging , without direct contacts ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I admittedly and strongly agree that [ the merits of email and messaging have reduced amount of ours time to communicate to | MajorClaim ] . Besides , [ we need to make sure for the real gathering with our colleague | Claim ] .

Target TANL: People should create a sense of co - operation in their children It is undeniable that children have an innocent mind , and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life . Some people think that it is better to make them competitive , while other believes to make them co - operative . Both these factors have their own values , and have been discussed in detail below :

Target TANL: [ Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently | Claim ] . This factor initially arises from the school , where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system , and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks . [ This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead | Premise | Supports = Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently ] , but will also restrict them in many ways . For example , [ MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work , and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team | Premise | Attacks = Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently ] .

Target TANL: However , [ those who wants to create a sense of co - operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead | Premise | Supports = they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team ] . Although , [ they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do | Premise | Attacks = they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team ] , but [ they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In my opinion , though [ competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co - operative child in an initial level | Premise | Attacks = co - operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team ] , but [ it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run | Premise | Attacks = competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co - operative child in an initial level ] ; while on the contrary , [ co - operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team | Claim ] .

Target TANL: To conclude , I would say that [ people should create a sense of co - operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Man to man interaction changed Nowadays , the variety of communication systems used widely . As technology develops , it has negative influences in many respects . However , I strongly agree with that [ the technology has large positive effects on relationships between people | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: The main advantage is that [ technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely | Claim ] . [ While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions | Premise | Supports = technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely ] . [ Instead of using letters , technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient | Premise | Supports = technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely ] . More , [ even if family members who are in different countries , they also can use the Internet to connect each others , especially though the images or videos , they can feel close | Premise | Supports = technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely ] . Furthermore , [ technology is also essential for students , live in remote districts , shared the valuable natural resources with friends | Premise | Supports = technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely ] .

Target TANL: Another issue is that in the ever - accelerated updating of science and technology , [ technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network | Premise | Supports = technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships ] . [ In the past , people might have had pen friends in other countries , but now , thanks to the social networking websites , people can easily to find someone who has similar interests | Premise | Supports = technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships ] . Also , [ they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet | Premise | Supports = technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships ] . In this way , [ technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I agree with that [ the technology has more optimal effects on people ' s interaction | MajorClaim ] , because [ it helps ordinary people to make new friends and to maintain relationships | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Sense of cooperation In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend , which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them , and also be able to teach them teamwork skill . However , some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative , both the values have its arguments .

Target TANL: [ A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers , and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents , to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system | Claim ] . Even though [ a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently | Premise | Supports = A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers , and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents , to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system ] , but [ it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others | Premise | Attacks = a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently ] . [ Being competitive leads them to success , but could also restrict them in many ways | Premise | Attacks = A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers , and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents , to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system ] . For example , [ it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project | Premise | Supports = Being competitive leads them to success , but could also restrict them in many ways ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ cooperation is also an essential quality for children , no matter in school activities or in communities | Claim ] . [ Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others , which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team | Premise | Supports = cooperation is also an essential quality for children , no matter in school activities or in communities ] . After all , [ in society , there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself | Premise | Supports = cooperation is also an essential quality for children , no matter in school activities or in communities ] . For example , [ famous singers or movie stars , despite of their talent to make them successful , there are always a team to manage works or deal with things | Premise | Supports = in society , there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself ] .

Target TANL: In my point of view , though [ competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success | Claim ] , but [ it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work | Premise | Attacks = competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success ] . To sum up , I would say that [ schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Discuss both harms and good of advertising and give your opinion On these days , with the assistance of advertisement , people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement . Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages , I believe that [ advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: On the one hand , it is clear that [ most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell | Premise | Supports = all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods ] . In addition to this , [ all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods | Claim ] . For example , [ some kinds of shampoo , namely Sunsilk , Clear , Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits | Premise | Supports = all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods ] . However , the fact is that [ not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement | Premise | Supports = all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers , writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands | Claim ] . Moreover , [ advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers | Claim ] . [ Take Coca cola for an example , this drinking firm is well - known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising | Premise | Supports = advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers ] . [ No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world | Premise | Supports = advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers ] . Last but not least , [ online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost , convenience and easily observing | Premise | Supports = advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception . From my point of view , advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product .

Target TANL: High sum of money of modern artist The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair . In a field of art , modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money . Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation , critics against such view . I agree that [ in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work | Claim ] . It is true while [ the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector | Premise | Supports = Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work ] . Also , [ the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent | Premise | Supports = Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work ] . For example , [ a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production | Premise | Supports = the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent ] . On the other hand , [ modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do , such making impossible become possible | Premise | Supports = Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work ] . [ Pieter Padang , Minion creator , has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric " I swear " become " underwear " when the Minion sing in Despicable Me | Premise | Supports = modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do , such making impossible become possible ] . [ He granted huge sums for such idea | Premise | Supports = modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do , such making impossible become possible ] .

Target TANL: Striking contrast , [ labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day | Premise | Supports = government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist ] . In any case , [ a musician playing " I swear " several times receives different earnings that Padang got | Premise | Supports = government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist ] because [ the musician re - plays the song without any creation | Premise | Supports = a musician playing " I swear " several times receives different earnings that Padang got ] . Moreover , [ government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist | Claim ] because [ there is no certain parameter to value it | Premise | Supports = government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist ] , [ art value is about taste | Premise | Supports = there is no certain parameter to value it ] .

Target TANL: Having said that [ the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art , while the term of struggle might different with other field of job | Claim ] . I agree that [ government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar | MajorClaim ] because [ art price is about taste | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Working Extended hours should restricted Working longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days . There is a saying in my native village , " Health is Wealth " . I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health . The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion . However , [ people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life | Claim ] . In my opinion , [ a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , many of us would agree to the fact that [ people ; who prefer working longer hours , do not find time to focus on their health | Claim ] . [ By working too long , they often become tired , lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick | Premise | Supports = people ; who prefer working longer hours , do not find time to focus on their health ] . Moreover , [ they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons | Premise | Supports = people ; who prefer working longer hours , do not find time to focus on their health ] . [ The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life | Premise | Supports = people ; who prefer working longer hours , do not find time to focus on their health ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign | Claim ] . As [ they usually remain busy in their office | Premise | Supports = they do not find leisure time for such social activities ] so [ they do not find leisure time for such social activities | Premise | Supports = these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign ] . For instance , [ I would take my boss ' s example ; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years | Premise | Supports = these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign ] . [ Recently , his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries | Premise | Supports = these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign ] . [ He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him | Premise | Supports = these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign ] .

Target TANL: To conclude this , [ I would strongly emphasis and recommend , Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies | MajorClaim ] . [ This will help in uplift of society , and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person | Claim ] .

Target TANL: A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money It ' s such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money , especially in nowadays society . Each individual visualize success differently . Still , [ my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ Money is undeniably pivotal | Premise | Attacks = a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard - working , dedication and passion ] , but [ ways of earning it is also various | Premise | Attacks = Money is undeniably pivotal ] . [ A person ' s great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself | Premise | Supports = a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard - working , dedication and passion ] . Nevertheless , [ a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard - working , dedication and passion | Claim ] . [ Whether it is a personal or a social achievement , that man is laudable | Premise | Supports = a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard - working , dedication and passion ] .

Target TANL: More importantly , [ the more beneficial for the society his achievement is , the more successful he is considered | Premise | Supports = judging a person by his income is difficult , especially in the success aspect ] . For instance , [ Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century | Premise | Supports = judging a person by his income is difficult , especially in the success aspect ] since [ his invention ' s productivity is countless useful for mankind | Premise | Supports = Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century ] . On the other hand , [ the fact of knowing a man ' s utilization of his money remains in the dark | Premise | Supports = judging a person by his income is difficult , especially in the success aspect ] . Therefore , [ judging a person by his income is difficult , especially in the success aspect | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ using only money as a scale to measure a man ' s success is impossible | MajorClaim ] despite the fact that [ it is the essential in basic needs | Claim ] . Yet , it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements , which can only accomplished by passion , dedication and ethics , are helpful not only for himself .

Target TANL: Advertising impact on people ' s choice of consumption Nowdays , people ' s choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television , street , magazine etc . This argument may be true that [ people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life | Claim ] . For example , [ in most asian countries , advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales , and some people , especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs | Premise | Supports = people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life ] .

Target TANL: In addition , [ products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement , people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought | Premise | Supports = A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want , even though it is not the real needs of the society ] . [ A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want , even though it is not the real needs of the society | Claim ] . And [ there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it | Premise | Supports = A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want , even though it is not the real needs of the society ] .

Target TANL: However , [ buying habit is a very personal things for individuals | Premise | Supports = the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy ] , [ the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy | Claim ] , [ sometimes it depends on one ' s needs and ability of consumption | Premise | Supports = the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy ] . [ It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income | Premise | Supports = the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy ] . [ Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase | Premise | Supports = the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy ] . On the other hand , [ children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not | Claim ] , since [ they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary | Premise | Supports = children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not ] .

Target TANL: In my opinion , I think [ buying habit is people ' s choice to make , not entirely affected by advertisements | MajorClaim ] . But [ for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop , it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising | Premise | Supports = it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company ( for example , toys company ) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need ] . So [ it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company ( for example , toys company ) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Schools should only teach children the academic subject People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school . Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school , [ I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Many people believe that [ students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics , physics | Claim ] because [ these subject are necessary for students ' future | Premise | Supports = students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics , physics ] . This is understandable [ when labor market now has high competition ; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification | Premise | Supports = students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics , physics ] . In addition , [ the unemployment rate is always high | Premise | Supports = parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job ] , so their [ parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job | Premise | Supports = students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics , physics ] .

Target TANL: Although those above reasons are acceptable , I would argue that [ there are many things much more important than having a job | Premise | Supports = these subjects might fulfil the students ' ability ] . Firstly , [ studying music , art or sports is also very important to students | Premise | Supports = these subjects might fulfil the students ' ability ] . [ This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them | Premise | Supports = studying music , art or sports is also very important to students ] . Secondly , [ to get a job in labor market , not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork , presentation | Premise | Supports = these subjects might fulfil the students ' ability ] . For instance , [ through taking part in a sport , students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills | Premise | Supports = to get a job in labor market , not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork , presentation ] . Therefore , [ these subjects might fulfil the students ' ability | Claim ] . Finally , [ children ' s future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school , it is the result of their efforts and capacity | Premise | Supports = these subjects might fulfil the students ' ability ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , although [ the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children | Claim ] , it seem to me that [ the effects of learning music , sports are profound | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe . With this advancement , newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence . Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media . But many other still thinks they are going to stay . I agree to the argument that [ newspapers and magazines will be history with the time | MajorClaim ] . I will establish my view by analysing how [ internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis | Premise | Supports = digital media will rule over paper and magazines ] . [ This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly | Premise | Supports = A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis ] . For example , [ when the aircraft MH 370 went missing , everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident | Premise | Supports = digital media will rule over paper and magazines ] . [ The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth | Premise | Supports = digital media will rule over paper and magazines ] . [ In such situations , newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media | Premise | Supports = digital media will rule over paper and magazines ] . [ Instead of waiting for next publication , people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two | Premise | Supports = digital media will rule over paper and magazines ] . This explains why [ digital media will rule over paper and magazines | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research , satisfy interest , etc | Claim ] . For example , [ one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War | Premise | Supports = People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research , satisfy interest , etc ] . [ It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at | Premise | Supports = People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research , satisfy interest , etc ] . But [ internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details | Premise | Supports = People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research , satisfy interest , etc ] . [ This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines | Premise | Supports = People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research , satisfy interest , etc ] .

Target TANL: To conclude , [ the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider | MajorClaim ] for valid reasons . Though [ considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people , paper media will continue for another few years | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Factor of choosing a career . In many societies , choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered . Nevertheless , while I admit that [ the salary is very pivotal factor | Claim ] , I claim that [ there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: To begin with , I agree that [ in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well | Claim ] . However , [ aspects such as : friendly colleagues , environment and work - place condition , sometimes , have even more impact on person ' s happiness and quality of life | Premise | Attacks = in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well ] . [ People , for instance , who don ' t like their co - workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs , despite of a high salary | Premise | Supports = aspects such as : friendly colleagues , environment and work - place condition , sometimes , have even more impact on person ' s happiness and quality of life ] . In this sense , it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position .

Target TANL: Further and even more importantly , [ most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements , skills and the position they reach | Premise | Supports = career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are , likely , more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary ] . In other words , [ career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are , likely , more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary | Claim ] . For example , [ people , who work in monotonous jobs , where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied , even though they have a very good salaries | Premise | Supports = career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are , likely , more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators | MajorClaim ] , as [ there are other even more important aspects such as : friendly co - workers , working conditions and professional achievements | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Children from poorer families are more successful in the future life . According to some people , child who is brought up in less well - off family is more quick - witted and can tackle with an adult life problems better than who is from affluent ones . However , I completely disagree with this position .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as : crime , thievery and thuggery | Claim ] . Moreover , [ these people will not have an access to a good education | Premise | Supports = they can be proselytized into bad isms ] . As a result , [ they can be proselytized into bad isms | Premise | Supports = children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as : crime , thievery and thuggery ] . For example , [ most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people | Premise | Supports = children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as : crime , thievery and thuggery ] , because [ the person with better education has a wider outlook , which will allow no brainwash | Premise | Supports = most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people ] . In this sense , [ people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms | Premise | Supports = children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as : crime , thievery and thuggery ] .

Target TANL: Nevertheless , [ people who are born in well - off families have access to good education , which will have a positive impact on their later life | Claim ] . Secondly , [ children from rich families have better skills on how to use money | Claim ] , because [ they use it a lot of times | Premise | Supports = children from rich families have better skills on how to use money ] . Finally , [ wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines , which will be very beneficial for the health of a child | Claim ] . For instance , [ many good medicines cost vast amounts of money , which cannot be afforded by poorer families | Premise | Supports = wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines , which will be very beneficial for the health of a child ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ I disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well - of families are , likely , more successful in the future life | MajorClaim ] due to aforementioned reasons .

Target TANL: Problems and benefits of international tourism Along with the advancement of long - distance transportation , international tourism has boomed in the last few decades . Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits . I disagree with this view .

Target TANL: I admit that [ tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment | Claim ] . [ In order to meet the needs of tourists , local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions , which may result in the destruction of natural habitats | Premise | Supports = tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment ] . [ Tourism also creates more pollution and waste , including growing emission of greenhouse gases , dumped leftovers and overuse of water , power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels | Premise | Supports = tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment ] . Based on these grounds , it seems that [ tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources , and it should not be encouraged | Premise | Supports = tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment ] .

Target TANL: However , [ flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy | Claim ] . [ Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions , but also pay for food , accommodation , transportation and entertainment | Premise | Supports = flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy ] . [ Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services , and more employment opportunities can be created as well | Premise | Supports = flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy ] . I also believe [ the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment | Premise | Supports = flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , [ the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well | Claim ] . [ The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably | Premise | Supports = the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well ] . [ With adequate local facilities and services available , they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing | Premise | Supports = the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well ] . In addition , [ both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before , and they can be more open - minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations | Premise | Supports = the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale | MajorClaim ] . Although [ there are some inevitable problems | Claim ] , [ they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken | Premise | Attacks = there are some inevitable problems ] .

Target TANL: How to learn children more efficiently Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual . Although , it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children , I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs . The reason for this is [ traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method | Claim ] . Thus , [ physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters ' skills | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child | Premise | Supports = teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens ] . [ Technology and its advance , to some degrees , have influenced the educational industry positively | Premise | Attacks = teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens ] . Nevertheless , [ it has not changed the importance of teachers ' role in classes | Premise | Attacks = Technology and its advance , to some degrees , have influenced the educational industry positively ] . The fact that [ students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this | Premise | Supports = Technology and its advance , to some degrees , have influenced the educational industry positively ] . [ Yet , monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators | Premise | Supports = teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens ] since [ their knowledge and adaptability is priceless | Premise | Supports = Yet , monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators ] . Therefore , [ teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it | Claim ] . On the other hand , [ children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity , cooperation , competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms | Premise | Supports = watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it ] . For instance , [ a conducted experiment indicates out - performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries | Premise | Supports = such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career ] . As a result , [ such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career | Premise | Supports = children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity , cooperation , competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , despite the fact that [ learning by watching TV suits some children | Claim ] , [ kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity | MajorClaim ] . [ School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages | Claim ] . Additionally , [ it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills | Claim ] .

Target TANL: The option to work or study from home is advantage or disadvantage Undoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one ' s personal as well as professional life . The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university . Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage . Both the points of views will be discussed in order .

Target TANL: On the one hand , [ the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous | Premise | Supports = the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home , are obvious ] . For one , [ it helps working people to maintain work life balance | Premise | Supports = the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home , are obvious ] . The best example is [ the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby | Premise | Supports = it helps working people to maintain work life balance ] . [ People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours | Premise | Supports = the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home , are obvious ] . [ For students too , studying from home is an attractive option | Premise | Supports = the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home , are obvious ] . [ They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies | Premise | Supports = For students too , studying from home is an attractive option ] . [ In a busy city like Tokyo , students waste a lot of time in travelling | Premise | Supports = For students too , studying from home is an attractive option ] . Thus , [ the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home , are obvious | Claim ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , one part of the society , has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home . Many employers argue that [ once an employee works from isolation , he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues | Premise | Supports = These factors affect people who work or study from home ] . [ This harms an employee ' s deliverable | Premise | Supports = These factors affect people who work or study from home ] . [ Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly | Premise | Supports = These factors affect people who work or study from home ] . Due to this they lag in their studies . [ These factors affect people who work or study from home | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Following both the point of views , [ the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks | MajorClaim ] . It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future .

Target TANL: Some celebrities misguide young people & some guide them in right direction Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do . While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation , [ this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: It is true that [ some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public | Premise | Supports = the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status ] . For example , [ some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media , thereby gaining the public attention | Premise | Supports = the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status ] . [ If they continue to behave in such a way , it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work | Premise | Supports = the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status ] . Consequently , [ the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status | Claim ] . This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits .

Target TANL: Nevertheless , I believe that [ other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments | Claim ] . Firstly , [ celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans | Premise | Supports = this kind of self - made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance ] . This means that [ people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results | Premise | Supports = this kind of self - made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance ] . Therefore , [ this kind of self - made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance | Premise | Supports = other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments ] . Secondly , [ other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career | Premise | Supports = other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments ] . [ Take Michael Jackson as an example , his works are widely spread around the world , and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation | Premise | Supports = other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career ] . [ His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other , which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society | Premise | Supports = other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career ] .

Target TANL: In summary , although [ some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance | Claim ] , [ other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Children can effectively learn from watching television TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it . But I believe that [ by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth | MajorClaim ] . [ If children spend too much time in front of TV , it will negatively impact their health and study | Claim ] .

Target TANL: It is true that [ TV is one of the prime source of data and information | Premise | Supports = By watching TV , children can develop skills in extra - curriculum activities ] . [ There are international and local news channels like BBC , CNBC , Etv Gujarati , Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings | Premise | Supports = By watching TV , children can develop skills in extra - curriculum activities ] . [ By watching TV , children can develop skills in extra - curriculum activities | Claim ] . For example , [ Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly , sports events like cricket , football can teach leadership skills , team building skills , communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs | Premise | Supports = By watching TV , children can develop skills in extra - curriculum activities ] .

Target TANL: But on other hand , [ watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health | Claim ] . For example , [ they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood , and also develop back pain | Premise | Supports = watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health ] . [ Sometimes , students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences | Premise | Supports = watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health ] . [ Many times , students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels , or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades | Premise | Supports = watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I believe [ demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits | Claim ] and thus [ if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Old and young workers Throughout human history , the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor . This is still true in the industrial society nowadays , where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over - 50 workers . There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace .

Target TANL: First and foremost , [ old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm | Claim ] . [ The old were raised in poverty , probably caused by war , look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view | Premise | Supports = old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm ] . [ The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change , or more precisely , to accept the existence of such modernity | Premise | Supports = old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm ] . For example , [ most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human ' s capability | Premise | Supports = old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life | Claim ] . In other words , [ that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology | Premise | Supports = their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life ] . [ This , by all means , is outweigh by youngsters ' adventurousness and bravery | Premise | Supports = their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life ] . [ Blatantly seen , success of most companies stems from young people , whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment | Premise | Supports = their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life ] .

Target TANL: Last but not least , [ knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly | Claim ] . [ Who would the employer choose , an old man with old - fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject , but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages | Premise | Supports = knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly ] . [ Not to undermine old workers , but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace | Premise | Supports = knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly ] .

Target TANL: All in a nutshell , [ workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects | Claim ] . However , in my point of view , [ it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Machines - positive or negative for humans Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades . This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days . These machines reduce the physical work done by humans . Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans . Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached .

Target TANL: It is felt by many that [ the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans | Claim ] since [ machines decrease the work done by people | Premise | Supports = the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans ] . For example , [ in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days | Premise | Supports = the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans ] . [ People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs | Premise | Supports = the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans ] . [ It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity | Premise | Supports = the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans ] . So [ this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects | Premise | Supports = the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans ] .

Target TANL: On other side of the coin , many people believe that [ usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work | Premise | Supports = using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome ] . [ Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens | Premise | Supports = using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome ] . [ The work of chopping , blending , grating , kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes | Premise | Supports = using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome ] . Thus it is very obvious that [ using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome | Claim ] .

Target TANL: After analyzing these two points of view , it is believed that [ using machines is advantageous | MajorClaim ] as [ machines make work easy and smooth | Claim ] . [ The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat | Claim ] because [ there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy | Premise | Supports = The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat ] . Therefore , it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free .

Target TANL: Way to reduce the amount of traffic ? Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots . The problem off traffic overload , caused by overpopulation , has aroused interest of many city planners . It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock . However , I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way .

Target TANL: First of all , [ public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street | Claim ] . [ Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options | Premise | Supports = public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street ] . Apparently , [ a bus can carry no less than 30 people , while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number | Premise | Supports = public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street ] . [ Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground , which leaves the street above with buses and non - fuel - based vehicles | Premise | Supports = public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street ] . Together , [ they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays | Premise | Supports = public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street ] .

Target TANL: Second , rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas . It is believed that [ if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt , the city street would be les burstling and overly - teemed as it is now | Premise | Supports = The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people ] . As a rule of thumb , [ huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities | Premise | Supports = The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people ] . [ The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ city planner can still opt for non - personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas | MajorClaim ] . It is highly recommended to put forward such solution , especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China , with the ever - growing demand for job or education .

Target TANL: Effect of celebrities on youth Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities . These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles . It is agreed that [ following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth | MajorClaim ] . This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors .

Target TANL: First of all , it is seen that [ following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents | Claim ] . [ Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age | Premise | Supports = following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents ] . For example , [ in a survey carried out in a university , it was asked to students that why did they start smoking , then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes | Premise | Supports = following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents ] . This example makes it clear that [ imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals | Premise | Supports = following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , it is believed that [ when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way | Premise | Supports = these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people ] . [ Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior | Premise | Supports = these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people ] . For instance [ recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools | Premise | Supports = these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people ] . So , this example makes it obvious that [ these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Thus to conclude , it can be said that [ when young people follow celebrities , it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way | MajorClaim ] . [ This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual | Claim ] . Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly , rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future .

Target TANL: The gender issue for getting education needs The gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources . Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held . Nowadays , [ there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course | MajorClaim ] . I strongly agree about this statement .

Target TANL: [ The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently | Premise | Supports = the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people ] . Automatically , [ the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people | Claim ] . We can see now that [ women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers , and dealing with machines | Premise | Supports = female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men ] . Those activities have proven that [ women can also do the men ' s works | Premise | Supports = female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men ] . Therefore , [ female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Another reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person ' s career . [ These days , it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities | Premise | Supports = giving equal education for both men and women is a must ] . So , [ learning from human ' s history , education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college | Premise | Supports = giving equal education for both men and women is a must ] . According to this opinion , [ giving equal education for both men and women is a must | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ the needs for having developed - skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone ' s career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender | MajorClaim ] . As the world ' s situation is always changing , [ act for distributing education needs are absolutely important to compete the future challenges | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Smoking should be made prohibited in public places People the world over have designated smoothing as a shameful practice and a lethal habit . Several millions of smokers die suffering from cancers such as lung and oral . This bad habit also responsible for causing health hazards to passive - smokers : who are around smoking is taken place . Thus , it is argued that [ smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations | MajorClaim ] . This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers .

Target TANL: To start , [ non - smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain | Claim ] . [ Prior to 1980 ' s public places in Sri Lanka , illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely | Premise | Supports = non - smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain ] . [ Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit , some instances that lead to belligerent incidents | Premise | Supports = non - smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain ] . [ After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public | Premise | Supports = non - smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain ] .

Target TANL: In addition to this , [ introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing | Claim ] . For instance , [ further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths , as per the ministry of health | Premise | Supports = introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing ] . As this shows , [ smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country ' s healthcare systems | Premise | Supports = introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing ] .

Target TANL: After analyzing smoke illegalization in public places in Sri Lanka , [ it has been proven benefits people enjoy this arrangement | MajorClaim ] . It is thus hoped governments would consider smoke banning in public places following footsteps of Sri Lanka as well as many other countries .

Target TANL: Tourism : good or bad ? Tourism , since its first appearance a long time ago , can be described as a controversial celebrity . Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion , environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places . However , I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons .

Target TANL: First of all , [ tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be | Claim ] . Basically , [ places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas , of which economy , before their appearance , haven ' t blossmed yet | Premise | Supports = tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be ] . [ Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up | Premise | Supports = tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be ] . [ It will , by all means , attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents | Premise | Supports = tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be ] . In other word , [ tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction , which exploit the best out of its own potential | Premise | Supports = tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , even though [ environmental damage is inevitable | Premise | Attacks = tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity ] , [ it is not tourism to be blamed for | Premise | Attacks = environmental damage is inevitable ] . [ In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction , the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration | Premise | Supports = tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity ] . To be precise , for instance , [ a fortune is spent on trimming the trees , watering the flowers , preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora , in the hope of beautifying the wild | Premise | Supports = tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity ] . [ Not to mention ecotourism , a new kind of environment - friendly service , which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures | Premise | Supports = tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity ] . Because of that , [ tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity | Claim ] .

Target TANL: All thing considered , [ tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact | Claim ] . In my opinion , [ the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Future information technology : positive or negative ? The appearance of information technology ( IT ) in the last 20 years has brought about significant developments in life standard as well as work efficiency . However , it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental . In my opinion , there is a likelihood that [ future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: With the rapid developing pace , [ IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves | Claim ] . [ In the past , there used to be World Wide Web or e - mail , but the cyber world now varies form games , online TV shows to means of communication , and probably still keeps going | Premise | Supports = IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves ] . [ Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones , resulting in their dependence on technical equipment | Premise | Supports = IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves ] . What is more , [ the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict | Premise | Supports = staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative ] , therefore , [ staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative | Premise | Supports = IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves ] .

Target TANL: Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues . [ The existence of Skype , Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click | Premise | Supports = rarely do people go out of their comfot zone , provided with snack and air conditioner , to assemble with others in flesh ] . As a result , [ rarely do people go out of their comfot zone , provided with snack and air conditioner , to assemble with others in flesh | Claim ] . Needless to say , [ their action will make a beeline for obesity , short - sighted , diabetes and other heart - related problems | Premise | Supports = rarely do people go out of their comfot zone , provided with snack and air conditioner , to assemble with others in flesh ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , despite the contribution of IT to the society , [ its effect on the users ' independence and prositution should not be out of concern | Claim ] . To my mind , [ there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual ' s life | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Vegetarianism - why some people are choosing to become vegetarian ? Since the dawn of time , human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources . Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family ' s meals all around the world . Recent years , however , has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians . Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue , others think it is much beyond that . It is clear to me that [ people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular | Claim ] . [ Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer | Premise | Supports = health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular ] . This fortifies the fact that [ a vegetable diet can do good for our health | Premise | Supports = health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular ] . Although some argue that [ a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake | Premise | Attacks = health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular ] , [ it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources | Premise | Attacks = a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake ] .

Target TANL: Secondy , relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet . [ Some religion , such as Buddha , believes that animals were human being in their previous life | Premise | Supports = eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings ] , so [ eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings | Premise | Supports = it is vital to follow one ' s own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind ] . It is often said that this view is rather unscientific . However , I am convinced that [ it is vital to follow one ' s own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind | Claim ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , it is evident for me that [ people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals | MajorClaim ] . However , a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended .

Target TANL: The maintenance of traditional skills and ways of life ? There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles . It is argued that these so - called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions , and there is no need to maintain them . However , from my point of view , [ what can be expected , is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: It is undeniable that [ the country ' s culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life | Claim ] . For instance , [ in Vietnam , many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities , are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts | Premise | Supports = the country ' s culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life ] . This means [ the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor ' s early life through books and images , which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed | Premise | Supports = the country ' s culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life ] .

Target TANL: In tradition , [ a person should look back at the past , mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle , to progress | Claim ] . [ Understanding why , and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today | Premise | Supports = a person should look back at the past , mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle , to progress ] . Also , [ study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing | Premise | Supports = a person should look back at the past , mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle , to progress ] .

Target TANL: To sumarize , [ there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life | MajorClaim ] . [ They are the ones that teach , and will teach us to be self - esteem and experienced , which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention | Claim ] .

Target TANL: The zoo deserves maintenance and public respect For a long time , the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals . However , other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing . In my opinion , [ the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect | MajorClaim ] for two specific reasons .

Target TANL: First of all , [ the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners | Claim ] . [ With zoos , pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of , for instance , a lion or a crocodile | Premise | Supports = the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners ] . At a higher level , [ it is of university students ' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings , which otherwise would not be at hand | Premise | Supports = the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners ] . This means that the [ zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels | Premise | Supports = the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection | Claim ] . [ Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats , which consequently calls for the help of zoos | Premise | Supports = the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection ] . What is more , [ the ever - increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species | Premise | Supports = the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection ] . [ Only when zoos appear are such distinction - driven animals as : giraffe , panda , koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory | Premise | Supports = the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection ] .

Target TANL: In sum , [ the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable | MajorClaim ] . It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency .

Target TANL: Languages ' extinction , discuss both views It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today ' s society are very concerned for . The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one . I personally suppose that [ no matter how widely they are spoken , every language should be protected from being disappeared | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: There are several reasons why [ saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money | Claim ] . Firstly , [ we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages , it can be really expensive | Premise | Supports = saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money ] because [ educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them | Premise | Supports = we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages , it can be really expensive ] . For example , [ some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese | Premise | Supports = the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers , facilities and appropriate materials ] , so [ the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers , facilities and appropriate materials | Premise | Supports = we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages , it can be really expensive ] . Secondly , it is obvious that [ in many aspects such as communication , trade , cooperation as well as transaction , it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Despite of the above arguments , i still strongly believe that [ the government should try to preserve minority languages | Claim ] . This is because [ language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication | Premise | Supports = the government should try to preserve minority languages ] . In addition , [ forming a language must be undergone thousands of years | Premise | Supports = it deserves to be respected and preserved ] ; thus , [ it deserves to be respected and preserved | Premise | Supports = the government should try to preserve minority languages ] . Last but not least , [ language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world | Premise | Supports = saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity ' s preservation ] . Therefore , [ saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity ' s preservation | Premise | Supports = the government should try to preserve minority languages ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , although [ letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial | Claim ] , [ it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Prevention is better than cure There has always been a saying in medicine : " Prevention is better than cure " . This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health - protected measures . In my opinion , [ this plan should be put into practice | MajorClaim ] for the two reasons mentioned accordingly .

Target TANL: [ No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes , especially at primary level , in the hope of raising people ' s awareness | Claim ] . [ Children should be taught about balanced diets , nutritious food as well as harmful ones | Premise | Supports = they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle ] , thereby [ they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle | Premise | Supports = No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes , especially at primary level , in the hope of raising people ' s awareness ] . What is more , [ it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of , for instance , not consuming too much fast food , over - fried food or intoxicants | Premise | Supports = No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes , especially at primary level , in the hope of raising people ' s awareness ] .

Target TANL: In addition , [ it will be of economic benefit to pre - empt certain kinds of diseases | Claim ] . Needless to say , [ such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune , not to cure , but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years | Premise | Supports = it will be of economic benefit to pre - empt certain kinds of diseases ] . Similarly , [ if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health - care product , obesity , myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance | Premise | Supports = it will be of economic benefit to pre - empt certain kinds of diseases ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , [ I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures | MajorClaim ] . [ This will yield positive results on not only the people ' s physical and mental development but also their finance | Claim ] .

Target TANL: University education restriction Universtiy is an entrance to life . It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed . It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people . Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage | Claim ] . To be precise , [ such abstract or complicated informatin , easily absorbed by those students , may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills | Premise | Supports = outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage ] . Besides , it is undeniable that [ one deserves what he has done | Premise | Supports = outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage ] . [ University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain | Premise | Supports = outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage ] .

Target TANL: However , [ university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills | Premise | Supports = it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people , who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively ] . Therefore , [ it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people , who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively | Claim ] .

Target TANL: What is more , [ there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people | Claim ] . [ Apart from the disheartened ones , many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs , mostly the white - collar ones | Premise | Supports = there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ university restriction has both pros and cons | Claim ] . In my opinion , [ it will yield more negative results than positive ones | Premise | Attacks = university restriction has both pros and cons ] . That ' s why [ it should be made available for a wide range of learners | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Teacher is the best option for children ' s education in some aspects Recently , there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children ' s education . Indeed , children grow up with two important people , their parents and teachers , and both are important in children ' s development . As far as I am concerned , I agree with the view that [ the teacher is the best option for children ' s education in some aspects | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: In the first place , [ school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education | Claim ] . For instance , [ to be able to obtain the teacher certificates , people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge | Premise | Supports = school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education ] . However , [ in comparison to teachers , parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children ' s subjects such as mathematics and physics | Premise | Supports = school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , [ teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children ' s communication skills | Claim ] . For example , [ after many years of teaching experience , teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries , facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills | Premise | Supports = teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children ' s communication skills ] . By contrast , [ parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way | Premise | Supports = teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children ' s communication skills ] .

Target TANL: Last but not least , [ compared with teachers , parents do not have enough time to spend with their children | Premise | Supports = it was impossible for them to be a good teacher ] . [ Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work | Premise | Supports = there is only limited time for them to teach their children ] , hence [ there is only limited time for them to teach their children | Premise | Supports = it was impossible for them to be a good teacher ] . Thus , [ it was impossible for them to be a good teacher | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ teachers are the best for children ' s education | MajorClaim ] . [ Not only do they contribute much to children ' s professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Salary is the most important consideration when choosing a job Along with the increasing physical demands of human life , salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone . I personally suppose that [ there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job | MajorClaim ] . In the following paragraphs , some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively .

Target TANL: On one hand , i agree that [ money is very essential in order to meet human ' basic needs | Premise | Supports = people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family ' s living needs such as food , clothes , accommodation , education , medication ] . More specifically , [ people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family ' s living needs such as food , clothes , accommodation , education , medication | Claim ] . It is obvious that [ people who are woking in art or painting industries , for example , will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably | Premise | Supports = people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family ' s living needs such as food , clothes , accommodation , education , medication ] . This is because [ they are doing what they love , their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths | Premise | Supports = people who are woking in art or painting industries , for example , will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , i believe that [ if we are passionate about what we are working , we are likely to achieve success easily in that field | Claim ] . [ There are plenty of people , who are now really successful , have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers , dancers and painters | Premise | Supports = if we are passionate about what we are working , we are likely to achieve success easily in that field ] . Besides , [ important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness , satisfaction of jobs , personal relationships , professional skills , working environment , managers and colleagues should not be underestimated | Premise | Supports = if we are passionate about what we are working , we are likely to achieve success easily in that field ] . Finally , [ some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies | Premise | Supports = if we are passionate about what we are working , we are likely to achieve success easily in that field ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , it is undeniable that [ income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers | Claim ] . Nonetheless , [ passion on jobs , in my opinion , can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Police force carries guns - significant impact for level of violence The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today ' s society are very concerned for . Few individuals assume that [ this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society | MajorClaim ] . I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs .

Target TANL: First of all , [ we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself | Premise | Supports = a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one ] . As a result , [ criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs | Premise | Supports = citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally ] . Thus , [ citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally | Premise | Supports = a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one ] . Moreover , [ while on duty , not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars , houses , streets are likely to be destroyed by guns | Premise | Supports = a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one ] . Therefore , [ a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ police force carries guns only in high crime societies | Premise | Supports = people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime ' s categories such as theft , robbery , murder , rape , vandalism , arson ] . Hence , [ people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime ' s categories such as theft , robbery , murder , rape , vandalism , arson | Premise | Supports = Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence ] . Obviously , [ Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , from the above views , although [ being armed with guns in the police force is necessary | Claim ] , [ it will bring the higher level of violence | MajorClaim ] . Additionally , the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians ' lives .

Target TANL: Negative effects of technological process It is undeniable that technological process has brought numerous benefits making human life become more and more comfortable and easy . Some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives . I personally disagree with this view . In the following paragraphs , both sides of the above matter as well as my own view ' s explanations would be analyzed and given , respectively .

Target TANL: Firstly , it is undoubtedly that [ thanks to modern technology invented recently , human life has been improved dramatically | Claim ] . [ Air - conditioners , computers , cellphones , washing machines , for example , is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities | Premise | Supports = thanks to modern technology invented recently , human life has been improved dramatically ] . Moreover , [ applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients ' lives | Premise | Supports = thanks to modern technology invented recently , human life has been improved dramatically ] .

Target TANL: However , some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly . In spite of bring fantastic advantages , [ technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process | Claim ] . This is because [ exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously | Premise | Supports = technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process ] . Last but not least , [ technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I totally believe that [ technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization | MajorClaim ] . [ We can not neglect profound impact of great technological process on human life | Claim ] . Nonetheless , its adverse effects need controlling more reasonably .

Target TANL: Large amount of violence in television programs Excessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society . Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today . Personally , I believe that [ governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids , while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Admittedly , [ reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could , to some degree , decrease the overall crime rate | Premise | Supports = it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies ] . However , in order to tackle this problem more effectively , [ governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs | Premise | Supports = it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies ] . [ As a result of mental immaturity , most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong | Premise | Supports = it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies ] . Little wonder , then , that [ by watching these violent TV programs and videos , juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes | Premise | Supports = it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies ] . Therefore , [ it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Nevertheless , [ it would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties , if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences | Claim ] . Frequently , [ adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day | Premise | Supports = it would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties , if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences ] . [ For whom , such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment | Premise | Supports = it would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties , if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences ] . [ Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors , they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them | Premise | Supports = it would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties , if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , it is my belief that [ violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency | MajorClaim ] ; however , the adults should not be the victim of this policy .

Target TANL: Do guns can really increase the level of violence ? The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world . Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act . Personally , I tend to disagree with this statement , while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence .

Target TANL: On the one hand , I agree that [ a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun | Premise | Supports = some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence ] . [ An obvious example of this happens in The United State , a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon , while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him | Premise | Supports = some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence ] . Obviously , [ police officers can force a criminal to surrender | Premise | Supports = some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence ] , because [ they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public | Premise | Supports = police officers can force a criminal to surrender ] . As a result , [ some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence | Claim ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities | Claim ] . Firstly , [ the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non - globalized countries | Premise | Supports = there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities ] . [ Many well - qualified and well - educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably | Premise | Supports = the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non - globalized countries ] . Secondly , [ cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive , so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs | Premise | Supports = there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities ] . [ Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport , for instance | Premise | Supports = cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive , so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , it seems to me that [ the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence | MajorClaim ] . However , some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment . In my view , the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act .

Target TANL: Life in Big Cities Vs People ' s health Today , more and more people are moving to big cities to live . However , while [ life in those cities is good in some ways | Claim ] , I completely argue that [ people ' s health would therefore be affected negatively | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before | Claim ] . [ Exhaust from transportation , especially cars , and factories ' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases | Premise | Supports = Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before ] . Besides , [ water pollution makes people ' s health become more critical | Premise | Supports = Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before ] . The fact is that [ dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people ' s bodies and create severe problems , which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time | Premise | Supports = water pollution makes people ' s health become more critical ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , [ it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink | Claim ] . [ Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today ' s market | Premise | Supports = it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink ] . Also , [ overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases , especially cough , sneezing and illness | Premise | Supports = it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink ] . Furthermore , [ living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas | Claim ] . [ Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary , pickpocketing , trickery , vandalism , smuggling or even murder | Premise | Supports = living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas ] . [ Earning money for living becomes more difficult , living healthy in such places is getting harder also | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I believe that [ life in big cities can have negative effects on people ' s health | MajorClaim ] . Thus , both government and individual should take steps to diminish the consequences involved .

Target TANL: Gun control and increasing violence Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society . To some extent , I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that [ criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , it seems to be true that [ if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease | Claim ] because [ fewer guns available mean less crime | Premise | Supports = if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease ] . However , [ this is not as simple as it sounds | Premise | Attacks = if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease ] .

Target TANL: In fact , [ stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime | Claim ] because [ most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally | Premise | Supports = stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime ] . [ People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns , regardless of gun control | Premise | Supports = stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , [ there will be law non - abiding people anywhere in the world , either polices or common citizens | Premise | Supports = the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself ] . As a result , [ the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself | Premise | Supports = if a government wants to control crime in a community , it is important to manage their people ' s actions rather than gun used in violent crimes ] . Therefore , [ if a government wants to control crime in a community , it is important to manage their people ' s actions rather than gun used in violent crimes | Claim ] .

Target TANL: All in all , it is obvious that [ there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate | MajorClaim ] . On the other hand , [ criminal mind seems to be more related to violence | Claim ] . Consequently , we should pay more attention to adjust people ' s behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control .

Target TANL: Education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country Education is undeniably an economic necessity . In most countries , it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly . In highly industrialized countries , undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all . I believe that [ education is the single most important factor in the development of a country | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ In a developing country , not many can afford to send their children to school | Premise | Supports = these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents ] . [ There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities | Premise | Supports = these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents ] . [ They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands | Premise | Supports = these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents ] . [ These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen , can hardly eat three meals a day , let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday | Premise | Supports = these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents ] . As a result , [ these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors , lawyers or engineers . [ Basic education teaches one child to read and write | Premise | Supports = the benefits of education can make a man , a society and a developed country ] . [ Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information | Premise | Supports = the benefits of education can make a man , a society and a developed country ] . [ A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self - sufficient | Premise | Supports = the benefits of education can make a man , a society and a developed country ] . [ A well - informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment | Premise | Supports = the benefits of education can make a man , a society and a developed country ] . In the same way , [ a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society | Premise | Supports = the benefits of education can make a man , a society and a developed country ] . Collectively , [ the benefits of education can make a man , a society and a developed country | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country | MajorClaim ] . [ The more people in the country become educated , the better chance it can develop | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Celebrities & Their Influences Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth . To some extent , I do not agree with this statement .

Target TANL: First of all , it is true that [ people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people | Claim ] . [ We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone , especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off | Premise | Supports = people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people ] . However , [ the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles | Premise | Supports = it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills ] . [ They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them | Premise | Supports = it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills ] . Therefore , [ it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , it seems to me that [ not many people can exist in the celebrities ' world without any talents or achievements | Premise | Supports = only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore , it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters ] . [ We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows , for example ; The Voice , X Factor or Next Top Models etc | Premise | Supports = to become a star and an inspiration for people , a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates ] . As a result , [ to become a star and an inspiration for people , a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates | Premise | Supports = only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore , it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters ] . Thus , [ only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore , it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation | Claim ] . That is the reason why [ celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Mobile phones : faster communication vs social problems Recently , there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life . Indeed , mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages . However , I believe , [ this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: In the first place , [ spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills | Premise | Supports = it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently ] . For example , [ as people , especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones , they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends , and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills | Premise | Supports = spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills ] . Moreover , [ continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children ' s eyesight and physical posture | Premise | Supports = it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently ] . As a result , [ it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , [ the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development | Claim ] . For instance , [ there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature | Premise | Supports = the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development ] . [ In these games , children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players , and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings , thoughts and behaviors | Premise | Supports = frequent conflicts may occur during communication ] . Consequently , [ frequent conflicts may occur during communication | Premise | Supports = the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development ] .

Target TANL: However , we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints . [ Mobile phones , such as smart phones , has made our communication easy and convenience | Premise | Supports = mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication ] . The reason is that , [ as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones , people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge | Premise | Supports = Mobile phones , such as smart phones , has made our communication easy and convenience ] . Thus , [ mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication | Claim ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , although [ mobile phones make our communication faster | Claim ] , [ it also gives rise to many social problems such as children ' s social skills and their mental health | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Is it necessary to teach children handwriting ? In this age of modern technology , some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children . To some people , it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task . From my point of view , [ children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting | MajorClaim ] for several reasons .

Target TANL: Despite the convenience from up - to - date facilities , [ handwriting still plays a vital role in students ' learning | Claim ] . Firstly , [ this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes , doing homework and writing | Premise | Supports = handwriting still plays a vital role in students ' learning ] . [ It enables to improve learners ' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well | Premise | Supports = this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes , doing homework and writing ] .

[ It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works | Premise | Supports = poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students ' school performance ] . Moreover , [ the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills | Premise | Supports = poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students ' school performance ] .

Target TANL: The tax reduction of state school for parents who have children studying in private system Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable . However , I am utterly convinced that [ these taxes are absolutely essential | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ by paying taxes for public school , affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor | Claim ] . It is true that [ many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course | Premise | Supports = by paying taxes for public school , affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor ] . [ With the the tax amount for which they pay , the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies , and earn a better quality of life | Premise | Supports = by paying taxes for public school , affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital | Claim ] . Obviously , [ this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation | Premise | Supports = the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue ] ; therefore , [ the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue | Premise | Supports = the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital ] . In addition , [ the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials , and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care | Premise | Supports = the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital ] .

Target TANL: Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that [ such tax payments are unfair for them | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Arts and public services are both important to the community and should be invested properly There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre . However , in my perspective , [ both public services and arts worth investment | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: It is obvious axiomatic that [ indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing | Claim ] . [ Investing in hospitals helps improve people ' s health , also , in schools assists with raising our children ' s education level | Premise | Supports = indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing ] . Apparently [ if these facilities were not spent adequately , our standard of living would deteriorate | Premise | Supports = indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing ] .

[ These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy | Premise | Supports = our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts ] . [ The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment , for instance K - pop and Hollywood , and these industries can not survive without goverment ' s financial assistance | Premise | Supports = our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts ] .

Target TANL: Modern technology has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways Nowadays , technology has been developing significantly , impacting many aspects of our life .

Target TANL: [ Thanks to modern technology , our life has been improved with many gadgets | Claim ] . [ The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working , it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries | Premise | Supports = Thanks to modern technology , our life has been improved with many gadgets ] .

[ Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology | Claim ] .

Target TANL: To give a brief conclusion , [ Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Drugs , alcohol and messy sex lives Celebrities , for example movie stars , are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend , etc . It is human nature that people , especially youngsters , are attracted to the celebrities they favour , and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible . But I tend to think that [ this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard | Premise | Supports = This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living ] . [ This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living | Claim ] . Further more , [ they will not value other people ' s hard work and take everything for granted | Premise | Supports = This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living ] .

Target TANL: Meanwhile , [ not all celebrities are role models | Premise | Supports = without proper parenting , children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living ] . [ It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols , having messy sex lives | Premise | Supports = without proper parenting , children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living ] . Worse still , [ without proper parenting , children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living | Claim ] .

Target TANL: A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues In today ' s world , the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens . I completely agree with the idea that [ governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system | Premise | Supports = society should be educated and became aware of health issues ] . I believe that [ decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients | Premise | Supports = society should be educated and became aware of health issues ] . Therefore , [ society should be educated and became aware of health issues | Claim ] so that [ the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients | Premise | Supports = society should be educated and became aware of health issues ] .

Target TANL: The second reason why [ governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society | Claim ] .

Therefore , [ a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives | Premise | Supports = governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society ] . For example , [ the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well - being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign | Premise | Supports = a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives ] .

Target TANL: [ The first reason why the father ' s role should be equal to the mother ' s role is the nature of parantage | Claim ] . In my view , [ the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child ' s characteristics | Premise | Supports = The first reason why the father ' s role should be equal to the mother ' s role is the nature of parantage ] . For example , [ in a traditional Turkish family , while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child , a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well - behaved child | Premise | Supports = the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child ' s characteristics ] .

Target TANL: [ The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today | Claim ] . In my opinion , [ we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life , including relationships | Premise | Supports = The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today ] . For instance , [ a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today ' s society | Premise | Supports = we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life , including relationships ] . Instead , [ all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals | Premise | Supports = The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today ] . Therefore , I believe that [ having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity | Premise | Supports = The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child ' s life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Children should studying hard or playing sport ?

Target TANL: More people are migrating to other countries than ever before The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries . People moved due to a number of reasons , namely better educations or higher salary jobs . Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures . However I strongly believe that [ they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments | Premise | Supports = sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential ] . [ Take Australia for example , immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues | Premise | Supports = sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential ] .

Target TANL: Email and text messaging threats written language The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication . With this situation , some people believe that [ they may be factors decreasing the position of written language | MajorClaim ] . I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means .

Target TANL: First of all , [ it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging , which answers to the question of their great popularity | Claim ] . [ Before email and mobile phone , human beings communicated by meeting directly , sending letters or later , calling from home phones | Premise | Supports = it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging , which answers to the question of their great popularity ] . [ Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness , difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information | Premise | Supports = it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging , which answers to the question of their great popularity ] .

Target TANL: Technology that widen the gap between rich and poor ? Technology , in the past two hundred years , has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society , such as telecommunications , manufacturing and buildings , etc . Certainly , technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives . However , today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor . Personally , I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons .

Target TANL: In the first instance , [ the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products | Premise | Supports = most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements , especially the poor people ] . [ About ten years ago , mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country , only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one | Premise | Supports = the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products ] . [ Today , mobile phones become a common one of household items , which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies | Premise | Supports = the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products ] .

Nevertheless , I think [ it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology , and technology is not the root cause of the gap | Premise | Attacks = the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ the good technology bringing to us is undeniable | MajorClaim ] . [ Under proper use of technology , the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Sporting events easing international tensions , releasing patriotic feelings For most folks on Earth , the need to gather in one place , and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation . This trend is so deeply engraved in people ' s mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned , even when some participants are facing grievous social problems . It is agreed that [ large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes , and help them being proud of their nation | MajorClaim ] . This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace , and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ during times of war , people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event | Premise | Supports = world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace ] . For example , [ when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War , its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers | Premise | Supports = during times of war , people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event ] . This clearly shows that [ international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back , sooner or later , to a relative peaceful normality | Premise | Supports = during times of war , people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event ] .

Target TANL: Should teenagers learn all school subjects / focus on one subject Presently , it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school . Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject . Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children . While , others claim that studying only one subject is more effective . Before rendering my own opinion , I will explore sides of this topic .

Target TANL: [ The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized | Claim ] . In the first place , [ with some basic knowledge of diverse fields , students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future | Premise | Supports = The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized ] .

Target TANL: Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that [ this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness | Claim ] . This is probably because [ students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects | Premise | Supports = this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness ] . However , the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected . Most importantly , [ under such target - oriented education environment , teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study | Premise | Attacks = this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness ] . Moreover , [ the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study | Premise | Attacks = this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness ] .

Target TANL: It is undeniable that [ concentrating on one subject can reduce students ' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents , while its shortfalls are so vital to students ' future | Claim ] . Therefore , [ I do support the view of learning all school subjects | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Is a break good or bad after high school for students Studies are an essential part of life . Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies , while in some countries , it is considered as waste of time . However , [ a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: In most education systems , a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age . [ A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change | Premise | Supports = a break will give students some time to refresh their systems , by traveling or following their hobbies ] . [ A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot , to follow instructions | Premise | Supports = a break will give students some time to refresh their systems , by traveling or following their hobbies ] . Personally , [ a break will give students some time to refresh their systems , by traveling or following their hobbies | Claim ] . Importantly , [ when students start their university studies after a break , they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge | Premise | Supports = a break will give students some time to refresh their systems , by traveling or following their hobbies ] .

Target TANL: Nevertheless , during high school , many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in . [ Working or traveling for some time , after high school , can help them to find their field of interest | Claim ] . [ It will also help them to learn professional setup by working | Premise | Supports = Working or traveling for some time , after high school , can help them to find their field of interest ] . [ Financially , students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job | Premise | Supports = Working or traveling for some time , after high school , can help them to find their field of interest ] . [ Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course | Premise | Supports = Working or traveling for some time , after high school , can help them to find their field of interest ] .

Target TANL: However , there are also disadvantages . [ A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental | Claim ] . [ When students work during these breaks , the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia | Premise | Supports = A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental ] . For instance , [ my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted | Premise | Supports = When students work during these breaks , the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia ] . [ When he started his university studies , he failed miserably | Premise | Supports = When students work during these breaks , the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia ] . [ Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time | Premise | Supports = A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental ] . But , the break should be an optional thing . [ It varies from individual to individual , how they utilize that period | Premise | Attacks = A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental ] . [ A break gives students more benefits than harms | Premise | Attacks = A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental ] .

Target TANL: Importantly , [ the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them | Claim ] . Thus , [ a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies | MajorClaim ] . Countries , like India , where such a break is considered a blot , should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut - throat competition . One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life .

Target TANL: The expression " Never , never give up " means keep trying and never stop working Many individuals throughout their life face with at least one failure in different areas such as education , love and economy . Some believe when a person faces with a failure the best way is to forget that and releases that ; however , I completely disagree with this idea . I always believe that [ a defeated person has to try and try until to achieve her or his goal | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure , therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes | Claim ] . For instance , [ most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats , but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems | Premise | Supports = when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure , therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes ] .

Target TANL: Second of all , [ experience shows while people doing a job constantly , they become more experienced in that subject , so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile | Claim ] . For example , [ scientists experiment a substance for a long time , after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final | Premise | Supports = experience shows while people doing a job constantly , they become more experienced in that subject , so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , I would maintain that [ people should not give up when they face with a failure | MajorClaim ] . In opposite , [ they have to learn new points from that failure , and they become more experienced | Claim ] .

Target TANL: should one follow fashion trends rather than a personal style ? With increasing availability to the Internet , people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world , such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best - liked clothes color this year . However , some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends . From my perspective , [ fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people ' s lives than personal dressing styles | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: This is because [ following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world ' s latest transformations , which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today | Claim ] . [ When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world ' s cutting - edge fashion information , they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world , which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world | Premise | Supports = following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world ' s latest transformations , which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today ] . In contrast , [ if they stuck to their own fashion styles , disregarding the world ' s top fashion designers ' achievements , they would stay conservative in their own worlds | Premise | Supports = they might fall behind shortly ] . As a result , [ they might fall behind shortly | Premise | Supports = following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world ' s latest transformations , which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , [ people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information | Premise | Supports = Without following fashion trends , such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes , let alone forming their own dressing styles ] . [ Without following fashion trends , such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes , let alone forming their own dressing styles | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Despite this , it is undeniable that [ following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals ' personalities | Premise | Supports = the world would look monotonous ] . [ Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends , which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes | Premise | Supports = the world would look monotonous ] . Consequently , [ the world would look monotonous | Claim ] .

Target TANL: With those arguments in mind , I would conclude that [ people should , especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge , care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world ' s changes | MajorClaim ] . On the other hand , [ creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas , developing their own fashion styles as they like | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Human activities are harming the Earth " Save the planet Earth " is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world . There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments . Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable , but [ concerns to save Earth are vital | MajorClaim ] due to various reasons .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world | Claim ] . [ The so - called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life | Premise | Supports = rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world ] . As we all know [ life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas | Premise | Supports = rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world ] . Moreover , [ wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth | Premise | Supports = rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer | Claim ] . [ Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays | Premise | Supports = large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer ] . To add to it , [ excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers | Premise | Supports = large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer ] .

Target TANL: Lastly , [ either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth | Claim ] . For instance [ a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent | Premise | Supports = either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth ] . [ Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers | Premise | Supports = either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth ] .

Target TANL: To conclude , [ Earth is our home and it should be protected | MajorClaim ] . Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage . Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life .

Target TANL: Concentrate on the objectives - people attend schools for various reasons From many centuries ago , universities have been playing an important role in ones ' life . Different people attend university for different point of views . In my perspective , [ the three most reasons are increased knowledge , career preparation and new experiences | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ for most people , university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding | Premise | Supports = they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying ] . Truthfully , [ in this wonderful academic environment , everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well - trained teachers | Premise | Supports = people are able to strengthen their knowledge ] . Thus , [ people are able to strengthen their knowledge | Premise | Supports = they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying ] . Moreover , [ through the instructions of teachers , the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory , library , students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect | Premise | Supports = they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying ] . Therefore , [ they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life , which included many new experiences . [ The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous , more than any school one person have studied | Premise | Supports = students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation , even from the whole world ] . Thus , [ students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation , even from the whole world | Claim ] . For instance , [ my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam , Brazil , Argentina , etc | Premise | Supports = students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation , even from the whole world ] . [ And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment , which is one of his main purposes when attending university | Premise | Supports = students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation , even from the whole world ] .

Target TANL: Last but not least , [ preparing for career is an essential function of university | Claim ] . [ Students not only do homework , assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work , internship and part time job | Premise | Supports = they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are ] . Thus , [ they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are | Premise | Supports = preparing for career is an essential function of university ] . After all , [ they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives | Premise | Supports = preparing for career is an essential function of university ] .

Target TANL: In summation , people may attend university for various reasons . Some want to enjoy new experiences , some are going to prepare for their future career , while others are eager to develop their understanding . Even though the purposes could be various , [ everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Educated high - school students with bright and independent mind High school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in . In my opinion [ high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice , to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , as I mentioned above [ students should have a right to choose what they want to study | Claim ] . [ Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights | Premise | Supports = students should have a right to choose what they want to study ] . [ As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams | Premise | Supports = students should have a right to choose what they want to study ] .

Target TANL: Next , [ students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades | Premise | Supports = Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit ] . Also , [ we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students | Premise | Supports = Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit ] . For example , [ when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other | Premise | Supports = Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit ] . [ Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Lastly , the most important reason I support this idea is [ he or she can explore in an area she / he has an aptitude | Premise | Supports = this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses ] . [ When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education | Premise | Supports = this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses ] . Furthermore , [ this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , as a young women [ I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement | MajorClaim ] so [ it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well | Claim ] . Having three reasons helps us to bring up students who are well - educated , with a bright and independent mind .

Target TANL: Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways It is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work . Besides the methods , from my point of view , [ providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work | MajorClaim ] . My arguments for this point are listed follows .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind | Premise | Supports = we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends , joking in class , enjoying new knowledge ] . Clearly , [ in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer , complaining from boss , etc | Premise | Supports = we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends , joking in class , enjoying new knowledge ] . Therefore , [ we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends , joking in class , enjoying new knowledge | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained | Claim ] . In this case , [ the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company | Premise | Supports = they will think about develop long term career with their company ] . So obviously , [ they will think about develop long term career with their company | Premise | Supports = employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained ] . For another thing , [ employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don ' t have this opportunity | Premise | Supports = employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained ] .

Target TANL: Thirdly , [ providing training will make employees happy with their current job | Claim ] because [ it help them improve their professional business knowledge | Premise | Supports = providing training will make employees happy with their current job ] . [ Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business | Premise | Supports = they will finish their jobs with excellent result ] , so I believe that [ they will finish their jobs with excellent result | Premise | Supports = providing training will make employees happy with their current job ] . Of course , [ excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss | Premise | Supports = providing training will make employees happy with their current job ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages | Claim ] . [ Training can help employees refresh their mind as well as make them happy , focus on work | Premise | Supports = providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages ] . Taking into account of all these factors , we may reach the conclusion that [ training can be effective in encouraging further good work | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Study at home by using technology / study or traditional school [ I don ' t think that technology can replace teachers and classroom | MajorClaim ] . Here are my reasons .

Target TANL: [ Studying at home by using technology is convenient | Claim ] . [ The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day | Premise | Supports = Studying at home by using technology is convenient ] . In addition , [ you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course | Premise | Supports = Studying at home by using technology is convenient ] . [ You can study any time you want | Premise | Supports = Studying at home by using technology is convenient ] . However , [ if you aren ' t extremely dedicated or have good time management skills , it may be very difficult to complete a course at home | Premise | Attacks = Studying at home by using technology is convenient ] .

Target TANL: First , [ attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience | Premise | Supports = Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects ] . Especially [ when you don ' t have an instructor there to guide you , it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements | Premise | Supports = Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects ] . [ Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects | Claim ] . Unfortunately , [ it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help | Premise | Supports = Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ studying at home is very different from traditional learning | Premise | Supports = Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision ] . [ Unlike traditional classes , distance education courses don ' t take place in a classroom , where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates | Premise | Supports = Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision ] . [ Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision | Claim ] . [ If you are the type that gets easily distracted , a distance - learning program may not be for you | Premise | Supports = Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , [ there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization - establishes relationship with classmates | Claim ] . [ We can learn a lot from programs at home | Premise | Attacks = there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization - establishes relationship with classmates ] ; however , [ our computers or televisions can ' t teach us how to get along with people | Premise | Attacks = We can learn a lot from programs at home ] . For example , [ students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork | Premise | Supports = there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization - establishes relationship with classmates ] . [ Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities | Premise | Supports = there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization - establishes relationship with classmates ] .

Target TANL: For the above reasons , I agree that [ distance education can ' t replace traditional school | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Farmland , housing and industry or saving land for animals ? Nowadays , there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals . People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance . As far as I am concerned , I agree with the opinion [ human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important | MajorClaim ] . The reasons are based on the following aspects .

Target TANL: First , [ land used for farmland , housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society | Premise | Supports = the needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important ] . There is no deny that [ the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture , real estate industry and industry , in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy | Premise | Supports = the needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important ] , because [ they produce plenty of profits | Premise | Supports = the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture , real estate industry and industry , in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy ] . What is more , [ the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry | Premise | Supports = the needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important ] . It is widely acknowledged that [ more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate | Premise | Supports = the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry ] . Thus [ the needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ farmland , housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life | Claim ] . It is clearly understood that [ farming , housing and industry provide us the food we eat , place we live , clothes we wear , which are essential to live | Premise | Supports = farmland , housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life ] . [ Especially in some poor areas , survival is the most significant thing | Premise | Supports = farmland , housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life ] . In addition , [ highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life | Premise | Supports = farmland , housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life ] .

Target TANL: Last I want to mention is that even though [ farmland , housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals | Premise | Attacks = it can do good to protect the endangered animals ] , [ it can do good to protect the endangered animals | Claim ] . According to the discuss above , [ agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy | Premise | Supports = it can do good to protect the endangered animals ] . With the economy development , [ we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals | Premise | Supports = it can do good to protect the endangered animals ] . For instant , [ we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct | Premise | Supports = we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals ] .

Target TANL: All in all , [ protecting endangered animals is necessary | Claim ] , nevertheless , [ human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Do zoos serve any useful function ? It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos . Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment . Over the time , there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals .

Target TANL: Some people spot out that [ humanities benefit so much from zoos | Claim ] . First of all , [ zoos are fascinating places of entertainment | Premise | Supports = humanities benefit so much from zoos ] . For this point , they all think that [ the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure | Premise | Supports = zoos are fascinating places of entertainment ] . Another function that [ all zoos serve relates to education | Premise | Supports = humanities benefit so much from zoos ] . [ Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world | Premise | Supports = all zoos serve relates to education ] . Moreover , [ some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct | Premise | Supports = humanities benefit so much from zoos ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , there are , however , people who think that [ zoos just take away freedom of animals | Claim ] . [ Being confined , animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented | Premise | Supports = zoos just take away freedom of animals ] . In their opinion , [ zoos are some kind of prisons and it ' s so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons | Premise | Supports = zoos just take away freedom of animals ] .

Target TANL: From my point of view , I agree with the first group . [ In modern life , zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers | MajorClaim ] . Besides , [ recently , zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature , taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity | Claim ] .

Target TANL: A university plans to devlope a new research centre in your country Most of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries . These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture . [ If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research , I would opt for the second one | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture | Premise | Supports = The centre for research in agriculture can help my co - citizens to better exploit these land ] . [ Most of these lands are left without any treatment | Premise | Supports = The centre for research in agriculture can help my co - citizens to better exploit these land ] . [ The centre for research in agriculture can help my co - citizens to better exploit these land | Claim ] . [ This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land | Claim ] . [ Especially , if they have no knowledge or education in this field | Premise | Supports = This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve | Claim ] . [ The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part | Premise | Supports = the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve ] . [ The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products | Premise | Supports = the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve ] . For example , [ the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country | Premise | Supports = the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve ] . [ The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product , how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms | Premise | Supports = the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve ] .

Target TANL: [ Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs | Claim ] . Obviously , [ showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money | Premise | Supports = Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs ] .

Target TANL: Some people think that [ a centre of business research is more important | Claim ] because [ we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field | Premise | Supports = a centre of business research is more important ] . For me [ being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business , but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction , and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that | Premise | Attacks = a centre of business research is more important ] .

Target TANL: [ My country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field , which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work , on the economy and on the employment | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: People learn in different ways and what teaching method do you prefer ? People have a lot of things to learn in their lives . They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills . [ One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about | MajorClaim ] . There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives .

Target TANL: First of all , [ learning by doing things develops our maturity | Claim ] . [ When you do things by your self , you learn to depend on yourself | Premise | Supports = learning by doing things develops our maturity ] . [ You will not be in need to refer to books or persons | Premise | Supports = learning by doing things develops our maturity ] . [ The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity | Premise | Supports = learning by doing things develops our maturity ] . For example [ if some one wants to learn how to be a leader , they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group , or even a situation | Premise | Supports = learning by doing things develops our maturity ] . [ We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading | Premise | Supports = learning by doing things develops our maturity ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about | Claim ] . [ There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them | Premise | Supports = learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about ] . [ Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing | Premise | Supports = learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about ] . [ People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming | Premise | Supports = learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about ] . [ Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming | Premise | Supports = learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about ] .

Target TANL: Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that [ we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things | Premise | Supports = we become motivated to learn other things by doing them ] . [ With the time , Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring | Premise | Supports = we become motivated to learn other things by doing them ] . [ Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things | Premise | Supports = we become motivated to learn other things by doing them ] . So [ we become motivated to learn other things by doing them | Claim ] .

Target TANL: The history shows that [ learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things | MajorClaim ] . People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn . They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn .

Target TANL: Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed by human Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue . Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth . However , I strongly believe that [ human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet | MajorClaim ] , for [ human are polluting the Earth ' s environment , exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ People are corrupting their ecosphere | Claim ] . [ In recent decades , concurrently with the increase of human consume , the waste discarded by human also multiplies | Premise | Supports = People are corrupting their ecosphere ] . [ These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a " new " continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage | Premise | Supports = People are corrupting their ecosphere ] . Furthermore , [ the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air , causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain , global warming or climate change | Premise | Supports = People are corrupting their ecosphere ] .

Target TANL: Besides , [ people are draining the Earth ' s natural resources | Claim ] . [ These resources such as oil , coal are vital for human activity | Premise | Supports = nowadays , the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people ] , therefore [ nowadays , the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people | Premise | Supports = people are draining the Earth ' s natural resources ] . [ Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un - recyclable and only several decades after , the Earth ' s natural resources are totally exhausted | Premise | Supports = people are draining the Earth ' s natural resources ] . [ At that time , human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources | Premise | Supports = people are draining the Earth ' s natural resources ] .

Target TANL: Also , [ people are endangering other species ' live | Claim ] . [ Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food | Premise | Supports = people are endangering other species ' live ] . [ Through million years of hunting , especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite , people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct | Premise | Supports = people are endangering other species ' live ] . Moreover , [ people , suffering from the population pressure , are expanding their living area | Premise | Supports = the living area of other species narrowed ] ; consequently , [ the living area of other species narrowed | Premise | Supports = people are endangering other species ' live ] . [ This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction | Premise | Supports = the living area of other species narrowed ] .

Target TANL: All in all , from discussed reasons , we can conclude that [ human activity are gradually destroy the Earth | MajorClaim ] since [ it is polluting the Earth environment , depleting the resource and imperiling other species ' lives | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Young people move to cities These days , there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities . Personally , I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this .

Target TANL: To begin with , the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that [ cities often offer more well - paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas | Premise | Supports = they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living ] . Obviously , [ many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career | Premise | Supports = they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living ] . Therefore [ they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living | Claim ] . For example , [ if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work , he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time | Premise | Supports = they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living ] .

Target TANL: However , this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences . There can be no doubt that [ the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities | Premise | Supports = cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation ] . As a result , [ cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation | Claim ] . Additionally , [ it might put strain on the environment | Premise | Supports = cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation ] . [ If there are more people in the cities , there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road , which causes air pollution | Premise | Supports = cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ young people tend to study or work in urban areas | Claim ] since [ these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials | Premise | Supports = young people tend to study or work in urban areas ] . In my opinion , however , [ I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Work in team or independently Nowadays , as the world is getting smaller , we need to be able to cooperate . Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success . Despite the importance of working in team , I still believe that [ the capability of working independly is more significant | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Of course , [ effective cooperation can make things easier and faster | Premise | Attacks = in many important cases when team - working is not possible , the ability to work alone will help ] , but [ in many important cases when team - working is not possible , the ability to work alone will help | Premise | Supports = if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college , acing your school ' s final tests , you should consider learning to work on your own ] . [ The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team - working | Premise | Supports = if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college , acing your school ' s final tests , you should consider learning to work on your own ] . [ Let ' s imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people , but you have no experience of working alone , standardized tests such as SAT , TOEFL may be your nightmares | Premise | Supports = if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college , acing your school ' s final tests , you should consider learning to work on your own ] . [ Testing is a very important aspect of life , and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team | Premise | Supports = if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college , acing your school ' s final tests , you should consider learning to work on your own ] . Therefore , [ if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college , acing your school ' s final tests , you should consider learning to work on your own | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , [ the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people | Claim ] . [ Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas | Premise | Supports = the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people ] . [ Everybody in a team must have his / her own opinion first , then discuss them with other members | Premise | Supports = the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people ] . [ When we work in team , we still think individually | Premise | Supports = the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people ] because [ our brain are not connected but separate | Premise | Supports = When we work in team , we still think individually ] . [ When everyone in a team can come up with his / her own ideas , working in team will definitely more effective | Premise | Supports = the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , working with a group a people and working individually are all important . Both skills are necessary for a successful life . Nevertheless , [ the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life Nowadays , the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before , parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them , just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods . Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that , for example , asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves . In my views , I agree that [ it is the best way for teenage children to take a part - time job to prepare their adult life | MajorClaim ] for several reasons .

Target TANL: First of all , [ when children get a job , they are able to earn money by themselves , instead of getting pocket money from their parents | Premise | Supports = it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money ] . Thus , [ it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money | Claim ] . Take me as an example , [ when I was 16 , I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own | Premise | Supports = I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money , and that did influence me in my life now ] . [ At the beginning of the semester , I was told to buy a text book | Premise | Supports = I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money , and that did influence me in my life now ] . Unfortunately , [ I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend | Premise | Supports = I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money , and that did influence me in my life now ] . Therefore , [ I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money , and that did influence me in my life now | Premise | Supports = it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ by taking a part - time job , they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done | Claim ] . For instance , [ if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work , the company may reduce his payment or even fire him | Premise | Supports = by taking a part - time job , they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done ] . [ To compare with the school life , they might suffer only a small punishment at school | Premise | Supports = by taking a part - time job , they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done ] . [ Under the circumstances , he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work | Premise | Supports = by taking a part - time job , they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ to help their children to adapt adult life , parents should let them experience it as much as they can | Claim ] . Due to the reasons given above , [ to encourage children taking a part - time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Environmental protection vs Economic developments Environmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century . They are both important because they are vital to human ' s future and welfare . However , since the budget and the recourse are limited , governments must choose between these two issues . In my opinion , I believe that [ tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments | MajorClaim ] . The following are reasons why .

Target TANL: First , [ environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments | Claim ] . [ All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one | Premise | Supports = environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments ] . [ Without Earth , whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain | Premise | Supports = environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments ] because [ we will all perish as she ' s gone | Premise | Supports = Without Earth , whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain ] . [ Just like a man that needs a healthy body , all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well | Premise | Supports = environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues | Claim ] . [ Environmental problems are global rather than local , which means that no countries can be spared from these problems | Premise | Supports = the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues ] . [ Take global warming for example , when the temperature increases , the whole globe is affected , suffering the hotter weather together | Premise | Supports = the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues ] . [ The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region , but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator | Premise | Supports = the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues ] , since [ the rising sea water could drown them | Premise | Supports = The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region , but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator ] . [ Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality | Premise | Supports = the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues ] because [ all humans are simply entwined together by our only home - Earth | Premise | Supports = Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality ] .

Target TANL: Some people might argue that [ economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside | Claim ] . They may say that [ if the economic is in a very bad situation , people would revolt instantly , while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away | Premise | Supports = economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside ] . However , [ the truth is that we ' ve been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now | Premise | Attacks = economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside ] . [ It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately , usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages | Premise | Attacks = economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence | MajorClaim ] . As mentioned in the second paragraph , how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy ? Similarly , how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by , ironically , by ourselves ?

Target TANL: Children managing their own money - best way to learn responsibility One of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility , specially in financially matters . Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility ? many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood . I am a kind of person who believes to [ children should learn to manage their own money at a young age | MajorClaim ] , due to reasons that I stated below .

Target TANL: The first important point that I want to make is that [ sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life , even though when we are not borne | Premise | Supports = it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues ] . So [ it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues | Claim ] . To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood , [ when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked | Premise | Supports = it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues ] . [ First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished | Premise | Supports = it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues ] . [ I asked my father for extra money , but he refuse to give it to me | Premise | Supports = it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues ] . [ I found that I should manage the way that I spend money | Premise | Supports = it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues ] . From then [ I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted | Premise | Supports = it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues ] .

Target TANL: Another aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family . [ If parents get the children all they wanted , they would be run out of their money for their essential needs | Premise | Supports = Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money , when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity ] . [ Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money , when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity | Claim ] . As a case in point , [ I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family , his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood | Premise | Supports = Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money , when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity ] . [ He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money | Premise | Supports = Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money , when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity ] . [ His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life , but unfortunately it was useless | Premise | Supports = Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money , when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity ] . [ Finally one night , having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car , he crashed a truck and died | Premise | Supports = Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money , when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity ] . [ Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property , but also bring sorry to his family | Premise | Supports = Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money , when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity ] .

Target TANL: Although some people argue that [ children should be free to spend money to they what they want | Claim ] , In my opinion [ it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons | MajorClaim ] , because [ our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Dancing plays an important role in a culture . In every country , people do dance for fun , for entertrain , and for decrease a stress . Dancing is also one of important parts of culture that represent to something that people believe . Many cultures do dance to show a great prosperous of its culture . And also dancing to entertain people . I will give reasons to support my opinion .

Target TANL: First , [ dancing are significant part of culture that could show to something that people believe | Premise | Supports = dancing are the part of people belief ] . For example , [ some culture people believe that they dance in order to sacrifice to their god so they will be get a happy life | Premise | Supports = dancing are the part of people belief ] . [ Or some part of the world that are in arid area believe that if they danced , the rain would come | Premise | Supports = dancing are the part of people belief ] . Consequently , [ dancing are the part of people belief | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ dancing can represent to civilization of that culture | Claim ] . For instance , [ I have seen many western movies that when a kingdom have visitor from another kingdom , king or queen would dance to show a splendid of their kingdom culture | Premise | Supports = dancing can represent to civilization of that culture ] . [ The way of movement , the way that they costume and also a music while they dance | Premise | Supports = dancing can represent to civilization of that culture ] . [ All this is a civilization of their culture | Premise | Supports = dancing can represent to civilization of that culture ] .

Target TANL: Thirdly , [ many culture , people have many ways to entertain themselves | Premise | Supports = dancing is one of that ways ] . And [ dancing is one of that ways | Claim ] . [ Both people who see and dance also have a good time | Premise | Supports = dancing is one of that ways ] . For example , [ many event , such as christmas , last christmas I went to mall to buy gifts , and I was entertained by group of people in santa custom dancing in christmas song | Premise | Supports = dancing is one of that ways ] . [ I felt that people around me happy and group of santas also happy to see people happy | Premise | Supports = dancing is one of that ways ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I strongly agree with notion that [ dancing is an important part of culture | MajorClaim ] because [ dancing are represent to believe of people | Claim ] . Besides , [ dancing could show how civilization of that culture is | Premise | Supports = dancing is important in every culture ] . Moreover , [ people use dancing to entertain themselves | Premise | Supports = dancing is important in every culture ] . So [ dancing is important in every culture | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Universities require students to study many subjects or specialize in one subject University is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life . Some universities require students to study in one subject . On the contrary , others require students to study in several subjects . In my point of view , [ studying many subjects is better that one | MajorClaim ] because [ students can study in subjects that they interested in , they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future | Claim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ when students finished their high schools , they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities | Premise | Supports = requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them ] . This is because [ they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all | Premise | Supports = when students finished their high schools , they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities ] . For example , [ pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music | Premise | Supports = requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them ] . Therefore , [ requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In addition , [ people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one | Claim ] . [ Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study | Premise | Supports = people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one ] . For instance , [ university students who study business are also know history of the world | Premise | Supports = Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study ] . Furthermore , [ students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience | Premise | Supports = people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one ] because [ they will meet new friends and teachers | Premise | Supports = students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience ] . Hence , [ they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another | Premise | Supports = people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one ] .

Target TANL: Finally , [ students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career | Claim ] . This is because [ graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer | Premise | Supports = students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career ] . For example , [ students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include | Premise | Supports = graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer ] . Moreover , [ bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge | Premise | Supports = students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career ] .

Target TANL: In concluding , [ learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject | MajorClaim ] because [ it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Governments should spend money on space exploration or for basic needs of people Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting , there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation . Thus , these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity . Therefore , in my opinion , I accede with notion that [ government should pay attention on basic needs of people first | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First , as you can see that [ after great economic recession , many people in many countries were unemployed | Premise | Supports = government should invest to create more jobs ] . Then , many people did not have money . [ When people did not have money , They had to rob other people | Premise | Supports = There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities ] . [ There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities | Premise | Supports = quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy ] . Consequently , [ quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy | Premise | Supports = government should invest to create more jobs ] . So that , [ government should invest to create more jobs | Claim ] . [ When people have jobs , they did not have to steal money | Premise | Supports = criminal rate were drop ] . Therefore , [ criminal rate were drop | Premise | Supports = people have a good quality life ] . Thus , [ people have a good quality life | Premise | Supports = government should invest to create more jobs ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it | Premise | Supports = government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy ] .

[ Greenhouse effect causes of climate change | Premise | Supports = government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide ] . [ These impact on every living creature in the world | Premise | Supports = government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide ] . So , [ government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide | Premise | Supports = government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy ] . In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide , [ government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Lastly , [ family is a root of society | Premise | Supports = government should create campaign to fill love to family ] . [ If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other , that family could have problems , If family had problems , it mean society could have problems | Premise | Supports = government should create campaign to fill love to family ] . [ When society had problems , it could impact to a nation | Premise | Supports = government should create campaign to fill love to family ] . Thus , [ government should create campaign to fill love to family | Claim ] . For example , [ setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other | Premise | Supports = government should create campaign to fill love to family ] . [ When family understand each other , it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble | Premise | Supports = government should create campaign to fill love to family ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I personally agree with statement that [ government should spend money on basic people needs | MajorClaim ] . The basic needs : jobs , good environment , and love in family . [ These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Staying in one place is better than moving number of places Some people may prefer to live in different places at different time because of many reasons such as looking for better job , house , community and so on .

[ In my hometown , I have a lot of friends and good relationships , I love the traffic in here , and the environment is wonderful | Claim ] .

Target TANL: I was born and grew up in here , a small town . [ In here , I have a lot of friends , and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer , basketball and of course we have a lot of fun | Premise | Supports = If anyone needs help , his neighbor will help as much as possible ] . [ Every people in my town have known each others , and we have good relationships | Premise | Supports = If anyone needs help , his neighbor will help as much as possible ] . [ If anyone needs help , his neighbor will help as much as possible | Claim ] . [ Nowhere else can give me some people like in here | Premise | Supports = If anyone needs help , his neighbor will help as much as possible ] .

Target TANL: I ' m against providing more money to professors University education is always an important part of one ' s life . That ' s why education in university is discussed all the time . What is the best way to orientate the students ? Raising the salaries of professors so ? I would say no . [ The professors are essential | Claim ] , however , [ the schools are established for students | Premise | Attacks = The professors are essential ] . [ Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources , which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors | MajorClaim ] . The following are my opinions .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors | Claim ] . I think [ the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively | Premise | Supports = the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors ] . [ By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment | Premise | Supports = the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors ] . [ A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer | Premise | Supports = students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning ] .

That is to say , [ students have a better environment to working on their assignments | Premise | Supports = the quality of their assignments will improve ] so [ the quality of their assignments will improve | Premise | Supports = the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation ] . Thus , [ the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation | Premise | Supports = By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment ] . [ In my school , the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby | Premise | Supports = the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors ] . For me , [ I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment | Premise | Supports = the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors ] . [ It ' s unpleasant to stay at school | Premise | Supports = the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors ] . However , [ coffee shops are not always quiet , so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly | Premise | Supports = the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors ] .

Target TANL: Besides , [ the ultimate purpose is to change , to motivate students to be better | Premise | Supports = To improve education , spending more money to raise professors ' salary is inappropriate ] . [ To improve education , spending more money to raise professors ' salary is inappropriate | Claim ] . In addition , will the university filter all the professors overall ? Some professors don ' t deserve the money at all , then , what ' s the point to spend money on them ? [ High - salary instructors don ' t teach students harder because they earn more money | Premise | Supports = To improve education , spending more money to raise professors ' salary is inappropriate ] . [ There won ' t be any effect if school does so | Premise | Supports = To improve education , spending more money to raise professors ' salary is inappropriate ] . [ There was news about raising professors ' salary in my country | Premise | Supports = if the policy of raising salary was supported , the demonstration would not happen ] . [ This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly | Premise | Supports = if the policy of raising salary was supported , the demonstration would not happen ] .

Target TANL: At school , students are priority . [ Students ' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university | Claim ] . That ' s the main reason [ I against providing more money to professors | MajorClaim ] . Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition .

Target TANL: Recent medical problems and sedentary lifestyle . It is certainly true that [ modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before | MajorClaim ] . Many people claim that [ it is because of sedentary lifestlyle | Claim ] . However , while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors , I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact .

Target TANL: To begin with , I agree that [ sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems | Claim ] . [ The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology | Premise | Supports = sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems ] . [ In earlier times , for instance , even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence | Premise | Supports = they had more outdoor activities ] and as a result [ they had more outdoor activities | Premise | Supports = sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems ] . [ Nowadays people , especially inhabitants of cities , are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools | Premise | Supports = sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems ] .

Target TANL: Nevertheless , there are some other causes why [ people are experiencing serious medical problems | Claim ] . Firstly , [ the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses | Premise | Supports = people are experiencing serious medical problems ] . [ Many people , for example , are suffering from allergy because of these gasses | Premise | Supports = the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses ] . Secondly , [ foods with a low quality such as fast foods , junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively | Premise | Supports = people are experiencing serious medical problems ] . Finally , [ life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam , traffic accidents and others | Premise | Supports = people are experiencing serious medical problems ] .

Target TANL: Given these evidences , it can be seen that [ people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses | MajorClaim ] due to aforementioned reasons .

Target TANL: Increased taxation on petrol and diesel fuel to discourage private cars ? There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced . However , cars themselves , especially private ones , have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption . [ While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation , I strongly disagree with this notion | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: One can not deny the fact that [ if petrol and fuel taxation are raised , people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile | Premise | Supports = Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains , buses or ferries ] . [ Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains , buses or ferries | Claim ] . Additionally , [ for those who have already afforded a car , there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities | Premise | Supports = Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains , buses or ferries ] .

Target TANL: However , [ taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation | Premise | Supports = people have to turn to cheaper alternatives , which might cause the abundance in goods and later on , economic crisis ] . To be precise , [ the more costly petrol is , the higher the price of necessary product : rice , meat or even vegetable | Premise | Supports = people have to turn to cheaper alternatives , which might cause the abundance in goods and later on , economic crisis ] . Consequently , [ people have to turn to cheaper alternatives , which might cause the abundance in goods and later on , economic crisis | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Another point that should be taken into account is [ countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters , both politically and financially | Claim ] . [ Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support , other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them | Premise | Supports = countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters , both politically and financially ] . [ America , for example , has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil | Premise | Supports = countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters , both politically and financially ] .

Target TANL: To summarize , [ higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons | Claim ] . However , [ it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues , making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: The environment problems facing today ' s world are so great Nowadays , many countries are concerned with the environment problems . There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that . Personally , I think [ both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment | MajorClaim ] , but we need to analyze some specific situations .

Target TANL: On one hand , [ solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies , and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems | Claim ] . For example , [ air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries , and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution , while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances | Premise | Supports = solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies , and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems ] . However , [ individuals are unable to cope with these things | Premise | Supports = solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies , and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems ] .

Target TANL: Besides , [ the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people | Premise | Supports = we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society ] . [ It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection | Premise | Supports = we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society ] . This means that [ we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society | Claim ] , and [ the government controls many influential media , such as TV stations and newspapers , which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens | Premise | Supports = we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection , and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment | Claim ] . For instance , [ many people driving private cars could cause air pollution , and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment | Premise | Supports = it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection , and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment ] . [ If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities , this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement | Premise | Supports = it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection , and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues , but every citizen also can contribute to the environment | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: International tourism is now more common than ever before The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide . While some might think [ the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries | Claim ] , I would contend that [ this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , it is an undeniable fact that [ tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations | Premise | Supports = international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries ] . [ Take Thailand for example , in the Vietnam War , many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities , these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded , even illegally involved in under - age prostitutes to maximize their profits | Premise | Supports = international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries ] . [ This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism | Premise | Supports = international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries ] . Therefore this proves that [ international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , there are clear evidences that [ tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals | Premise | Supports = tourism has threatened the nature environments ] . [ As the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown , the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder , namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors , dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions | Premise | Supports = many marine lives have been endangered , in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species ] . For this reason , [ many marine lives have been endangered , in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species | Premise | Supports = tourism has threatened the nature environments ] . Thus , it is apparent that [ tourism has threatened the nature environments | Claim ] .

Target TANL: To conclude , I strongly believe that [ the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments | MajorClaim ] . If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values , they will be destroyed in the near future .

Target TANL: Living and studying overseas It is every student ' s desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment . While some students study and live overseas to achieve this , some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas . In my opinion , [ one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience | MajorClaim ] for several reasons .

Target TANL: First , [ studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures | Claim ] . [ Compared to the peers studying in the home country , it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself / herself into new environments and situations in life | Premise | Supports = studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures ] .

Target TANL: Paying more money is the only motivation to make employees work harder The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard - working and productive is by raising their salaries . In this essay , I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this .

Target TANL: [ A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places | Claim ] . [ Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss ' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile | Premise | Supports = A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places ] . For instance , [ junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students ' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work | Premise | Supports = A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places ] due to the fact that [ it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want | Premise | Supports = junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students ' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work ] .

Target TANL: Should government control media crime The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that [ it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Obviously , violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences .

Target TANL: Should all the advertisements be banned ? Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information . Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public . My view is that [ while some of them are disturbing , we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First , [ it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In order to protect animals , from my perspective , [ zoos offer a good man - made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals | MajorClaim ] . What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better .

Target TANL: Advertising - positive or negative part of our lives Nowadays , the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers , radio and television has become very prevalent , so it is thought to be a necessary part of today ' s society . Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this . Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn .

Target TANL: First , it is generally understood that [ advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more | Premise | Supports = Advertisements are , therefore , very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits ] . [ Advertisements are , therefore , very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits | Claim ] . Also , [ to consumers , advertising can bring them many benefits | Claim ] . For example , [ customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies | Premise | Supports = they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans ] and hence [ they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans | Premise | Supports = to consumers , advertising can bring them many benefits ] . From all of these , it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support .

Target TANL: However , it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts . Firstly , [ a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses , this is generally known as spam , and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people | Claim ] . Secondly , [ advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results | Premise | Supports = advertising is believed by many , a financial burden to businesses ] . Therefore , [ advertising is believed by many , a financial burden to businesses | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising , both of the views have strong support , but it is felt that [ more good comes from advertising than bad | Claim ] . Thus , [ the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city ? Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world , but still there are some differences among them . From my point of view [ big cities can be a good place for bringing up children | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: To begin with , it is undeniable that [ education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides | Premise | Supports = it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities ] . For instance , [ in my country the best schools , universities and institutes are located in cities , and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children ' s life | Premise | Supports = it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities ] . Therefore , [ it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities | Claim ] .

Target TANL: What is more , [ it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities | Premise | Supports = Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment ] . [ Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment | Claim ] . For example [ playgrounds , parks , science museums , cinemas etc | Premise | Supports = Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment ] . However , [ in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities | Premise | Supports = Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment ] . [ Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms | Premise | Supports = Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment ] .

Target TANL: Finally , [ in big cities children access to media easily | Premise | Supports = they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net ] , so [ they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net | Claim ] . [ Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world | Premise | Supports = they can exchange their knowledge , they can learn different cultures ] , therefor [ they can exchange their knowledge , they can learn different cultures | Claim ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , although [ countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air , peace , and etc | Claim ] . [ Today ' s children needs somethings to entertain them , and occupy their leisure time in the best way | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: A single international language or not ? The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization , which raises people ' s concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not . From my perspective , [ a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: It is especially true if we consider the fact that [ a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation | Premise | Supports = a single international language serves an economic purpose ] . [ As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language , they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade , which can intensify the transnational cooperation | Premise | Supports = a single international language serves an economic purpose ] . In contrast , [ without the availability of the same language , there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations , impeding collaborations between them | Premise | Supports = a single international language serves an economic purpose ] . Therefore , [ a single international language serves an economic purpose | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Also , [ a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions | Claim ] . [ If people are equipped with a single international language , they can tell each other smoothly about their countries ' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles , which enables people to expand their outlooks , viewing the world in new angles | Premise | Supports = a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions ] . For example , [ when people travel to foreign countries , the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language , helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience | Premise | Supports = If people are equipped with a single international language , they can tell each other smoothly about their countries ' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles , which enables people to expand their outlooks , viewing the world in new angles ] .

Target TANL: In spite of this , the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied . To be more specific , [ a single international language may , to some extent , erode the cultural identity of a nation | Claim ] . This is because [ people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language , eroding a sense of national belong | Premise | Supports = a single international language may , to some extent , erode the cultural identity of a nation ] . For instance , [ some Asians are seeking individualism , previously denied by many Asian countries | Premise | Supports = people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language , eroding a sense of national belong ] , due to the fact that [ they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies , which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English | Premise | Supports = some Asians are seeking individualism , previously denied by many Asian countries ] .

Target TANL: Therefore , I would conclude that [ a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication | MajorClaim ] . On the other hand , [ every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Roles of international sports events Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place , it attracts millions of people all over the world . As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border , [ popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First and foremost , [ sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another | Premise | Supports = they can improve their results , break records and bring victories to their own countries ] so that [ they can improve their results , break records and bring victories to their own countries | Claim ] . Because [ a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events | Premise | Supports = there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures ] , [ there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures | Premise | Supports = sport events with the spirit of healthiness , honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding , friendship and solidarity among nations ] . Consequently , [ sport events with the spirit of healthiness , honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding , friendship and solidarity among nations | Claim ] . [ After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition , the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners , which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations | Premise | Supports = sport events with the spirit of healthiness , honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding , friendship and solidarity among nations ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators | Premise | Supports = sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen ] . [ Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete | Premise | Supports = sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen ] . [ The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country | Premise | Supports = sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen ] . [ When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others , many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness | Premise | Supports = sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen ] . For instance , [ when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008 , a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets | Premise | Supports = When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others , many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness ] . [ People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags , banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President | Premise | Supports = When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others , many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness ] . [ The eager atmosphere lasted many next days | Premise | Supports = When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others , many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness ] . In fact , [ some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally | Premise | Attacks = When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others , many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness ] . However , [ the hooligans only took a minority of people | Premise | Attacks = some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally ] . Therefore , it can be said that [ sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely | MajorClaim ] . Hence , I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future .

Target TANL: Children engagement in paid work In many countries , children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions . Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities . However , some people think it ' s not a good educational measure . From my point of view , [ the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ children can learn about the hardship of earning money | Premise | Supports = they are likely to understand their parents ' hardship , to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving ] . [ When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies , doing housework and keeping shops , they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life | Premise | Supports = they are likely to understand their parents ' hardship , to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving ] . Therefore , [ they are likely to understand their parents ' hardship , to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ when children take jobs , they tend to be more responsibl | Claim ]e because [ whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working | Premise | Supports = when children take jobs , they tend to be more responsibl ] . [ To keep their jobs , children will have to try their best to finish their duties | Premise | Supports = when children take jobs , they tend to be more responsibl ] . For example , [ if a child works as a shop assistant , he will have to keep an eye on good and products , calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost | Premise | Supports = To keep their jobs , children will have to try their best to finish their duties ] .

Target TANL: Some people may argue that [ children will be more material , neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers | Claim ] . However , [ if children get good care and instructions from their parents , they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way | Premise | Attacks = children will be more material , neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents ' permission , they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible | MajorClaim ] . I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children ' s study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children ' s labour .

Target TANL: Jury must have access to criminals ' past records Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant , except those of the UK and Australia . Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries .

Target TANL: Many people hold the opinion that [ past behaviour determines the future actions | Claim ] , which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury . We must acknowledge that [ complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant ' s personality | Premise | Supports = past behaviour determines the future actions ] . Furthermore , [ past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes , such as kidnapping or a murder | Premise | Supports = past behaviour determines the future actions ] .

Target TANL: Nevertheless , [ in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience , the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only | Claim ] . For instance , [ a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record | Premise | Supports = in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience , the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only ] . [ Innocent suspects , eventually , can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions | Premise | Supports = in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience , the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant ' s history to the jury , with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict | Claim ] . Thus , [ I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia , and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: The Internet is an adequate source of academic information Over the past few decades , the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization , especially in field of education . This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students . Consequently , direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized . However , the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists . Personally , I believe that [ the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First and foremost , [ the Internet is an adequate source of academic information , which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils | Claim ] . [ Nowadays , not only are lectures available online , it is also applicable to find reference e - books as well as multi - aspect documents on the cyberspace | Premise | Supports = the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever ] . As such , [ the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever | Premise | Supports = the Internet is an adequate source of academic information , which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils ] . Moreover , [ with the use of the Internet , distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance | Premise | Supports = the Internet is an adequate source of academic information , which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils ] . [ College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries | Premise | Supports = with the use of the Internet , distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance ] . Last but not least , [ the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying | Premise | Supports = the Internet is an adequate source of academic information , which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils ] . [ While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes , Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query | Premise | Supports = the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying ] .

Target TANL: In the near future , [ the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training | Claim ] , for the enormous benefits that it brings about . [ Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously | Premise | Supports = the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training ] ? [ This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances | Premise | Supports = the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training ] .

Target TANL: Critics may argue that [ the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively , for instance internet abuse and black webs | Claim ] . However , we should bear in mind that [ these problems are mainly triggered by students ' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself | Premise | Supports = what we are to do is a change in learners ' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study ] . Thus , [ what we are to do is a change in learners ' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study | Premise | Attacks = the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively , for instance internet abuse and black webs ] .

Target TANL: After analyzing both points of view , [ I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process | MajorClaim ] . It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages . However , it is not just the matter of help or hindrance , it is the way you use the cyberspace . Be wise and conscious .

Target TANL: Early retirement for 55 + employees to help younger people Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty - five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy . Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young , others claim that this is not the case .

Target TANL: Admittedly , [ encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty - five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits | Claim ] . Firstly , [ fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation | Premise | Supports = encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty - five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits ] . This is because [ they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities | Premise | Supports = fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation ] . Secondly , [ having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency | Premise | Supports = encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty - five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits ] . [ Compared with aged staffs , younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline | Premise | Supports = having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency ] .

Target TANL: However , [ sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences | Claim ] . [ From personal level , it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations | Premise | Supports = sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences ] . It is undeniable that [ every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it , disregard the age and physical capacity | Premise | Supports = From personal level , it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations ] . [ From social perspective , massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government | Premise | Supports = sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences ] . For example , [ sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently | Premise | Supports = From social perspective , massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , even though [ the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits | Claim ] , it is convincing that [ it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Can technology alone solve the world ' s environmental problems ? It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems . Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems . In the following paragraphs , I intend to discuss both viewpoints .

Target TANL: Some people say that [ if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment | Claim ] . They argue that [ it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment | Premise | Supports = if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment ] . [ If people don ' t use air conditioners , automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us , then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment | Premise | Supports = if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand there are people who say that [ technology alone could save the environment | Claim ] . They opine that [ now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back | Premise | Supports = technology alone could save the environment ] . [ We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart | Premise | Supports = technology alone could save the environment ] .

Target TANL: [ There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot | Claim ] . [ One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa | Premise | Supports = There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot ] . [ By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes , we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource | Premise | Supports = One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa ] . Furthermore , [ Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030 | Premise | Supports = There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot ] . [ By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun , it could meet the entire world ' s electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions | Premise | Supports = There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot ] . [ If successful , the impact on the world would be monumental | Premise | Supports = There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot ] . [ It would mean energy for schools , hospitals , and homes | Premise | Supports = If successful , the impact on the world would be monumental ] . [ It would mean another industrial revolution | Premise | Supports = If successful , the impact on the world would be monumental ] .

Target TANL: To put it in a nutshell , I pen down saying that , [ technology alone can solve the world ' s environmental problems | MajorClaim ] . We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place . It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life .

Target TANL: Computers replace human teachers With the number of technological advances growing apace , it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future . This idea may point out to two main directions , both of which present different arguments .

Target TANL: Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that [ the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information , which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate | Claim ] . [ Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge , ranging from visual to aural stimuli , which make learning an ever enjoyable experience , especially for children | Premise | Supports = the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information , which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable , there still remain certain shortcomings . [ Much information as the Internet may provide , most of the sources are unjustified by experts | Premise | Supports = information from those sources is subject to question ] . As a result , [ information from those sources is subject to question | Claim ] . Admittedly , [ the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong | Premise | Attacks = it cannot give as an in - depth explanation as a human teacher can ] but [ it cannot give as an in - depth explanation as a human teacher can | Claim ] . [ Through face - to - face communication , teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore , adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students | Premise | Supports = it cannot give as an in - depth explanation as a human teacher can ] . [ This is where the computer proves to be incompetent | Premise | Supports = it cannot give as an in - depth explanation as a human teacher can ] .

Target TANL: In short , although both sides have their equally valid arguments , I am inclined to think that although [ Internet can be a useful tool for education | Claim ] , [ at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: One or two close friends vs . a large number of casual acquaintances There is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance . However , I still agree that [ it ' s better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: We can not deny that [ being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant | Premise | Supports = it ' s much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends ] . First , [ it ' s not easy to make friend with anyone | Premise | Supports = being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant ] . I believe [ friends are people who have great compatibility with each other | Premise | Supports = being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant ] . [ After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities , for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways | Premise | Supports = being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant ] . [ Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances | Premise | Supports = it ' s much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends ] . [ We spend time together but we could never be friend | Premise | Supports = it ' s much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends ] . So , [ it ' s much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ close friends can easily understand each others feelings | Claim ] . Because of the similarity I talked before , [ acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends | Premise | Supports = close friends can easily understand each others feelings ] . Moreover , [ they wouldn ' t even spare time to consider your feelings | Premise | Supports = close friends can easily understand each others feelings ] . [ Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time | Premise | Supports = close friends can easily understand each others feelings ] . [ Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend | Premise | Supports = close friends can easily understand each others feelings ] . [ When my friend is sick , I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible | Premise | Supports = a friend is a person you care about ] . [ If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail , I will try my best to pull him back , but not stand and stare like it ' s not of my business | Premise | Supports = a friend is a person you care about ] . And I believe [ my friend will do the same to me | Premise | Supports = a friend is a person you care about ] . In conclusion , [ a friend is a person you care about | Claim ] .

Target TANL: To me , [ friends are the most important people in my life second to my family | MajorClaim ] . I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends , and I am fully content that I have such nice friends . If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances , I will definitely say NO .

Target TANL: Living in a higher pace is better There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace , and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks , while others seem to prefer the opposite position . After deeply pondering over this issue , I also develop my own perspective . I favor the former ; that is , [ I prefer to live in a higher pace condition | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that [ we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks , and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam | Premise | Supports = we have to be eager in our lives ] . [ I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam | Premise | Supports = we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks , and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam ] because [ I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place ; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test | Premise | Supports = I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam ] . Therefore , we can start to agree that [ we have to be eager in our lives | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Apart from the one I have mentioned above , another equally important aspect is [ keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy | Premise | Supports = keeping our pace higher is important ] . [ If I can avoid being a sluggish person , I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully | Premise | Supports = keeping our pace higher is important ] . For instance , [ I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition , defeating those spending less time on practicing | Premise | Supports = If I can avoid being a sluggish person , I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully ] . Hence , from this case we are capable of stating that [ keeping our pace higher is important | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some people proclaiming that [ with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more | Claim ] because [ it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed | Premise | Supports = with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more ] . However , from my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying . [ I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy | Premise | Attacks = with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more ] . In contrast , [ it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment | Premise | Attacks = I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy ] .

Target TANL: Based on the reasons demonstrated above , I believe that [ living in a higher pace is better | MajorClaim ] because [ the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite | Claim ] . In other words , [ I prefer to live in high pace | MajorClaim ] . It is not to say , of course that other points of view are totally without merit . Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible .

Target TANL: Teachers lesson vs other sources The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations , and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change . Despite the argument of some people that [ learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources | Claim ] , I firmly believe that [ both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children ' s acquisition of knowledge | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: It is undeniable that [ the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students ' acquisition of knowledge | Premise | Supports = technologies are vital in students ' learning ] . [ Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields , and as the students answer these questions , the facts has been learned and reinforced | Premise | Supports = technologies are vital in students ' learning ] . [ A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams , as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time | Premise | Supports = technologies are vital in students ' learning ] . Moreover , [ when students have some academic problems , they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs | Premise | Supports = technologies are vital in students ' learning ] . Besides , [ in the past , conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves , now all can be done at a click of a button | Premise | Supports = technologies are vital in students ' learning ] . Thus , [ technologies are vital in students ' learning | Claim ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators | Premise | Supports = formal education approaches are also indispensable ] . [ At schools , students ' development has been orchestrated stage by stage , step by step by experienced teachers , and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way | Premise | Supports = formal education approaches are also indispensable ] . Therefore , [ formal education approaches are also indispensable | Claim ] .

Target TANL: To put it all in a nutshell , I pen out saying that [ alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children ' s development | MajorClaim ] . So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome .

Target TANL: Protect animals or not ? Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons . While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species , others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention . In my opinion , [ we should give priority to our own issues | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that [ biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem | Premise | Supports = it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible ] . [ If certain species are absent from this system , such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species , including human beings , will come under threat | Premise | Supports = it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible ] . Therefore , [ it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible | Claim ] .

Target TANL: However , I think [ species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution | Claim ] . [ The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being | Premise | Supports = species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution ] . [ A great number of plants and animals died out | Premise | Supports = species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution ] because [ they were unable to fit into the new environment | Premise | Supports = A great number of plants and animals died out ] . On most occasions , [ the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it | Premise | Supports = species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , [ human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation , disease and wars | Premise | Supports = We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species ] . [ When these problems are taken into account , extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help | Premise | Supports = We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species ] . [ We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals , and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Improved medical care Along with the development of technologies , advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy . Although [ the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system | Claim ] , I am inclined to believe that [ the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ The main advantage of high - tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health | Claim ] . [ They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy | Premise | Supports = The main advantage of high - tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health ] because [ healthy workers can create more productivity | Premise | Supports = They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy ] . In other words , [ they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment | Premise | Supports = this saves an amount of time as well as cost ] so [ this saves an amount of time as well as cost | Premise | Supports = The main advantage of high - tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health ] .

Target TANL: In addition , [ a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society | Premise | Supports = the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people ] . In facts , [ young people will be happy as their parents , grandparents are healthy | Premise | Supports = the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people ] . It can be said that [ the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people | Claim ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , some people maintain that [ the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system | Claim ] because [ more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system | Premise | Supports = the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system ] . Although it is real in some aspects , I believe that [ the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time | Premise | Supports = they are worth to have good care ] , so [ they are worth to have good care | Premise | Attacks = the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system ] . [ They have given their effort to the society so that young people , the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system | Premise | Supports = they are worth to have good care ] .

Target TANL: By way of conclusion , it is true that [ the development of the health care system helps people have a better life | MajorClaim ] . [ It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old | Claim ] .

Target TANL: The opportunity to receive education from university There are many factors that contribute to one ' s success . However , which factor is the most influential one is open to debate . Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one ' s success . It seems that [ one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family | MajorClaim ] . I agree with this statement . In my opinion , [ family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success | MajorClaim ] . There are a couple of reasons .

Target TANL: First of all , [ more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university | Premise | Supports = they can provide more advices and helps in our career ] . Since [ our parents receive better education than our grandparents did | Premise | Supports = they can provide more advices and helps in our career ] , [ they can provide more advices and helps in our career | Claim ] . [ In the past , seldom people have the chance to attend a collage | Premise | Supports = they can provide more advices and helps in our career ] . For example , [ my grandparents did not get a education even in high school | Premise | Supports = when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood , he had to go to his teacher for help ] , so [ when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood , he had to go to his teacher for help | Premise | Supports = they can provide more advices and helps in our career ] . [ Things have changed a lot | Premise | Supports = they can provide more advices and helps in our career ] . [ I grow up in a better condition than my father did | Premise | Supports = they can provide more advices and helps in our career ] . [ Whenever I have problems , I can always ask my parents for help | Premise | Supports = they can provide more advices and helps in our career ] . [ They can solve the problem quickly | Premise | Supports = Whenever I have problems , I can always ask my parents for help ] because [ they have learned quite a lot | Premise | Supports = They can solve the problem quickly ] .

Target TANL: What is more , [ family members can help us in many other aspects | Claim ] . For example , [ when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university , my father told a lot about different majors | Premise | Supports = family members can help us in many other aspects ] . [ He shared his own experience with me , which helped me quite a lot | Premise | Supports = family members can help us in many other aspects ] . [ Parents are quite experienced than their child | Premise | Supports = they can guide them toward the right direction ] , [ they can guide them toward the right direction | Premise | Supports = family members can help us in many other aspects ] . Besides , [ parents can told their children as many as they can | Premise | Supports = family members can help us in many other aspects ] . [ What they want is help their child to make a progress | Premise | Supports = family members can help us in many other aspects ] .

Target TANL: In a word , [ our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life | Claim ] . I believe that [ with the help of our family , we can achieve success quite easily | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Living with a roommate is better than Living alone Many single people have difficulties deciding whether to live with a roommate or to live alone . Each makes different decisions . Some people choose to live alone for privacy , while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons . As far as I am concerned , [ I prefer to live with a roommate | MajorClaim ] . This is because [ it saves me money , enables me to socialize , and allows me to get help | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money | Claim ] . [ If you have roommates , you can split the rent and utilities among them | Premise | Supports = Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money ] . This means [ you can get more for less | Premise | Supports = Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money ] . For example , [ last year , I shared a room off - campus with my friend , and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half : I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating , and two hundred dollars for rent monthly | Premise | Supports = Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money ] . [ I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills | Premise | Supports = Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money ] .

Target TANL: Apart from saving a lot of money , [ living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily | Claim ] . [ It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you | Premise | Supports = living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily ] . [ You can invite your roommates ' friends over to your room and have fun together | Premise | Supports = living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily ] . For instance , [ one night , my roommate , Millan , brought his friends along | Premise | Supports = living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily ] . [ Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other , we quickly got to know each other | Premise | Supports = living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily ] . [ We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games | Premise | Supports = living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily ] . [ We played a video game called ' Halo ' together all night , and became good friends | Premise | Supports = living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily ] . [ Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me | Premise | Supports = living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily ] .

Target TANL: Finally , [ living with a roommate allows me to get help | Claim ] . [ It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need | Premise | Supports = living with a roommate allows me to get help ] . [ When you run into a problem , you can ask your roommates if they can help | Premise | Supports = living with a roommate allows me to get help ] . [ Some of them may have something to offer | Premise | Supports = living with a roommate allows me to get help ] . To illustrate , [ when my computer mysteriously broke down , I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help | Premise | Supports = living with a roommate allows me to get help ] . [ They failed to give me any useful solutions | Premise | Supports = living with a roommate allows me to get help ] . [ To my surprise , one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help | Premise | Supports = living with a roommate allows me to get help ] . [ He was very good with computers , and he managed to fix the problem quickly | Premise | Supports = living with a roommate allows me to get help ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , while [ many people decide to live alone for various reasons | Claim ] , [ I prefer to live with a roommate , and I always will | MajorClaim ] . This is because [ it offers me many advantages , such as less spending , more socializing , and more help | Claim ] . I think single people should live with a roommate , if they want to enjoy their lives .

Target TANL: Some people believe that there should be fixed punishment for each crime type Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders . Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime . Alternatively I believe that [ it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions , that forces to a person to be a criminal | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all [ if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime | Claim ] because [ the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime | Premise | Supports = if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime ] . Secondly , [ laws and rules are there for people | Premise | Supports = it is necessary to have a look behind crime ] therefore [ it is necessary to have a look behind crime | Claim ] for instance " [ a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women , who steals for her drug addiction | Premise | Supports = it is necessary to have a look behind crime ] " . [ The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place | Premise | Supports = it is necessary to have a look behind crime ] .

Target TANL: On the contrary , [ fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government | Claim ] . [ Everyone should be treated equally | Premise | Supports = fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government ] because [ sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal | Premise | Supports = fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other ] . Therefore [ fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other | Claim ] .

Target TANL: To conclude , [ Government should decide for punishment case by case basis | MajorClaim ] . In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution .

Target TANL: A more convenient life in a city There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town . The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner , quieter and often friendlier place to live . However , despite the advantages of small town life , [ I prefer to live in a big city | MajorClaim ] for several reasons .

Target TANL: On the one hand , [ I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area | Claim ] . To make it convenient , [ I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace | Premise | Supports = I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area ] . What ' s more [ I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city | Premise | Supports = I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town | Claim ] . [ You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities | Premise | Supports = life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town ] . For instance , [ you can visit museums to learn history , and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading , or you can go to a sports center for exercising | Premise | Supports = life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town ] . But [ a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs | Premise | Supports = life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore [ living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation , like all kinds of information | Claim ] . [ If one can efficiently acquire the information , then , there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals | Premise | Supports = living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation , like all kinds of information ] . For example , [ there are various advertisements here an there , whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones | Premise | Supports = living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation , like all kinds of information ] . [ If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel , or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store , he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice | Premise | Supports = living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation , like all kinds of information ] .

Target TANL: [ There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring | Claim ] . [ Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government , which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers | Premise | Supports = Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high - quality education which is very important for their future development ] . [ Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high - quality education which is very important for their future development | Premise | Supports = There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities , and have my children receive a better education , a big city is the place to live in | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: The precondition of doing research by professors Nowadays , many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities . Although [ research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field | Premise | Attacks = the research takes up too much teaching time ] , [ the research takes up too much teaching time | Claim ] . As far as I am concerned , [ professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: To begin with , it is vital that [ professors should assist students to acquire knowledge | Premise | Supports = professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research ] . [ The professors’ duty is to nurture students , and prepare excellent courses | Premise | Supports = professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research ] . [ If professors spend a lot of time on research , he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced , which may decrease the quality of classes | Premise | Supports = professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research ] . [ The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting - edged technologies | Premise | Supports = professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research ] . In this way , [ professors should provide well - preparation courses to convey the state - of - art knowledge for college and university students | Premise | Supports = professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research ] . Therefore , [ professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research | Claim ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ if professors are busy in doing research , ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students , it would ruin the reputation of universities | Premise | Supports = spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors , rather than research ] . [ Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course , and the enrollment of universities may decline | Premise | Supports = spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors , rather than research ] . [ Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study | Premise | Supports = spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors , rather than research ] . In this way , [ hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects | Premise | Supports = It is adverse to the whole academic field ] . [ It is adverse to the whole academic field | Premise | Supports = spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors , rather than research ] . Accordingly , [ spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors , rather than research | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Nevertheless , [ professors could teach students through research and projects | Claim ] . [ Some students enjoy taking part in some research | Premise | Supports = professors could teach students through research and projects ] . [ Through to use the equipment and invent their own work , they may get more experience in the process of research | Premise | Supports = professors could teach students through research and projects ] . For instance , [ electronic students always invent new machines such as robots , MP3 and remote control car | Premise | Supports = Through to use the equipment and invent their own work , they may get more experience in the process of research ] . [ They can manage the electric theory in practical skills | Premise | Supports = Through to use the equipment and invent their own work , they may get more experience in the process of research ] . [ And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions | Premise | Supports = Through to use the equipment and invent their own work , they may get more experience in the process of research ] . However , [ only under specific circumstance , when students master all of the systematic knowledge , can they accomplish research | Premise | Supports = professor should concern about preparing class ] . [ This is requires professors provide high quality courses | Premise | Supports = professor should concern about preparing class ] . In other word , [ professor should concern about preparing class | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Consequently , [ conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent | Premise | Attacks = Only by developing students , can we have a better academic field ] . However , [ the precondition of doing research is growing students’ solid theory fundamental | Premise | Attacks = conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent ] . [ Only by developing students , can we have a better academic field | Claim ] . [ Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Apartments vs dormitories at university Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city . Both options have their advantages and disadvantages . After considering the level of freedom , the studying conditions and the economic factor , if I had to choose , [ I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First , [ an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory | Claim ] . [ While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules , in the apartment you set your own rules | Premise | Supports = an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory ] . [ You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want | Premise | Supports = an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory ] . [ An apartment offers more privacy | Premise | Supports = an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory ] because [ you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student | Premise | Supports = An apartment offers more privacy ] . This is an important factor because [ you also get more space than you would in a dormitory | Premise | Supports = an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory ] .

Target TANL: Second , from an economic point of view , people often argue that [ an apartment is more expensive | Claim ] . This is only partially true , [ you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper | Premise | Attacks = an apartment is more expensive ] . [ Transportation is another issue , you have to go to and return from the university everyday | Premise | Supports = an apartment is more expensive ] . [ You could choose to use public transportation , a cheaper option , or to have a car | Premise | Supports = an apartment is more expensive ] . [ The car is an expensive option , but also offers freedom of schedule and destination | Premise | Supports = an apartment is more expensive ] .

Target TANL: Lastly , [ the studying conditions are better in an apartment | Claim ] because [ you don ' t have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories | Premise | Supports = the studying conditions are better in an apartment ] . [ A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times | Premise | Supports = the studying conditions are better in an apartment ] . Since [ in an apartment you don ' t have a roommate | Premise | Supports = you won ' t have this problem ] , [ you won ' t have this problem | Premise | Supports = you would be able to concentrate better ] , and as a result [ you would be able to concentrate better | Premise | Supports = the studying conditions are better in an apartment ] . For the same reason , [ you won ' t have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music , bring friends over , or study late at night | Premise | Supports = the studying conditions are better in an apartment ] . [ You set your own schedules | Premise | Supports = the studying conditions are better in an apartment ] . In the other hand , [ living in a dormitory , and being surrounded by students also has some advantages , like being able to get help with any academic issues from them | Premise | Attacks = the studying conditions are better in an apartment ] .

Target TANL: To conclude , both options have their advantages , but personally I think [ the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Why are groups or organizations important to people ? During our life , it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations ; therefore , groups and organizations are an important part of their lives . In my point of view , [ groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals | MajorClaim ] . My reasons include the following :

Target TANL: In the first place , [ humans are a part of the society , and the society includes a wide variety of groups | Premise | Supports = the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization , from children to adults ] . Most of all , [ the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization , from children to adults | Claim ] . [ We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life , and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life | Premise | Supports = almost of us live in the environment of groups ] . [ By making teamwork , the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others | Premise | Supports = almost of us live in the environment of groups ] . [ As university students , it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others | Premise | Supports = almost of us live in the environment of groups ] . [ After graduating from schools , employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits | Premise | Supports = almost of us live in the environment of groups ] . Thus , [ almost of us live in the environment of groups | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ By participating in an organization , it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose | Claim ] . [ A solid group can be a suited environment , which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons | Premise | Supports = By participating in an organization , it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose ] . For example , [ as a student majoring in mass media , I have taken part in mass media student group for a year | Premise | Supports = A solid group can be a suited environment , which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons ] . [ When being in the department of art , I have not only learned how to do a project , but also known some famous artists during the term | Premise | Supports = A solid group can be a suited environment , which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons ] . Above all , [ it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job | Premise | Supports = A solid group can be a suited environment , which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , [ groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal | Claim ] . Here is an example : [ there are various charities in the world | Premise | Supports = groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal ] . [ Tzu Chi , a non - profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan , is famous for contributing to the social and community services , and medical care | Premise | Supports = groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal ] . [ They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit | Premise | Supports = groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal ] . [ For accomplishing their missions , the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks | Premise | Supports = they lit the light for the poor and victims ] . As a result , [ they lit the light for the poor and victims | Premise | Supports = groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal ] ; in addition , [ they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world | Premise | Supports = they lit the light for the poor and victims ] .

Target TANL: For the above reasons and examples , it could be widely thought that [ groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Should the Government Provide Free College ? Some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college . However , I believe that [ individuals should pay their college tuition | MajorClaim ] because [ it would cost too much , the college education is a personal ' s choice , and there are many ways to fund a college education | Claim ] .

Target TANL: First , [ making college education free would cost too much | Claim ] . [ It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement , infrastructure and so forth | Premise | Supports = making college education free would cost too much ] . [ There are many other needs which should come first , such as providing health care to all American , or improving public schools | Premise | Supports = making college education free would cost too much ] . In addition , [ it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education | Premise | Supports = it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds ] . Consequently , [ it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds | Premise | Supports = making college education free would cost too much ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ it is a personal choice to go to a college | Premise | Supports = those people should make the financial investment in their own choice ; not the government ] . [ Not everyone wants to go to a college | Premise | Supports = those people should make the financial investment in their own choice ; not the government ] . [ People who want to make more money , and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education | Premise | Supports = those people should make the financial investment in their own choice ; not the government ] . Therefore , [ those people should make the financial investment in their own choice ; not the government | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Third , [ there are many ways to fund a college education | Claim ] . [ People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship , financial aids , and other funds | Premise | Supports = there are many ways to fund a college education ] . In addition , [ the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means | Premise | Supports = there are many ways to fund a college education ] . [ They often provide services such as fire departments , medical assistance , and police protection for the schools and their students | Premise | Supports = there are many ways to fund a college education ] . [ They also provide funds for academic research | Premise | Supports = there are many ways to fund a college education ] . [ While the money is not given to individual students , these contributions are not trivial | Premise | Supports = there are many ways to fund a college education ] .

Target TANL: In short , [ the individual should finance his or her education | MajorClaim ] because [ it is a personal choice | Claim ] . Otherwise , [ it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the governmen | Claim ]t .

Target TANL: Where to learn a new language ? Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country , I firmly believe that [ people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ Person ' A ' who learns a non - native language in his country may receive benefit from a step - by - step teaching method | Claim ] . In other words , [ he is not jumping into the foreign country | Premise | Supports = he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language ] . Therefore [ he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language | Premise | Supports = Person ' A ' who learns a non - native language in his country may receive benefit from a step - by - step teaching method ] . Besides , [ all the learners are probably from the same country | Premise | Supports = all these people most likely have learned the language , more or less , in the same way ] , so [ all these people most likely have learned the language , more or less , in the same way | Premise | Supports = Person ' A ' who learns a non - native language in his country may receive benefit from a step - by - step teaching method ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken , he has the opportunity to communicate with natives | Premise | Supports = he can learn most useful idioms , proverbs and so many other things which the former person , person ' A ' , does not have access to ] . [ He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country | Premise | Supports = he can learn most useful idioms , proverbs and so many other things which the former person , person ' A ' , does not have access to ] . No doubt , [ it leads to better understanding of language essential skills | Premise | Supports = he can learn most useful idioms , proverbs and so many other things which the former person , person ' A ' , does not have access to ] . [ He also has access to the most up - to - date language | Premise | Supports = he can learn most useful idioms , proverbs and so many other things which the former person , person ' A ' , does not have access to ] . Thus [ he can learn most useful idioms , proverbs and so many other things which the former person , person ' A ' , does not have access to | Claim ] .

Target TANL: On the whole , [ if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel , I would definitely make the second choice | Premise | Supports = When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language , you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible ] . [ There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language | Premise | Supports = When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language , you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible ] . [ When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language , you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In a word , although each of these methods have their pros and cons , I am pretty sure that [ advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one ' s life Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man ' s life , people might have different preferences : some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends , while [ other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends | MajorClaim ] . In my view , I prefer the second attitude .

Target TANL: The first reason is that [ staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others ' experiences | Claim ] . For instance , [ among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport , or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before | Premise | Supports = staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others ' experiences ] .

Target TANL: Of course , [ while differences give the opportunity to learn , they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement | Claim ] . [ This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends | Premise | Supports = while differences give the opportunity to learn , they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement ] . In fact , [ in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same | Premise | Supports = while differences give the opportunity to learn , they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement ] .

Target TANL: Another reason is that [ a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open - minded | Claim ] . For example , [ if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice , your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages | Premise | Supports = a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open - minded ] .

Target TANL: [ When you have just few close friends , on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more | Claim ] , but on the other hand [ they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours , adding less to your experience | Premise | Attacks = When you have just few close friends , on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more ] .

Target TANL: In sum , although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points , I think that [ spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one ' s life | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources [ The development of public transportation is the most essential thing for a developed society | MajorClaim ] . [ Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources , the air pollution , the loss of a sense of community | Claim ] . So , I think the government have to spend more money on improving it .

Target TANL: [ The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out | Claim ] . [ Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move | Premise | Supports = The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out ] . [ If people use too many private cars , the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly | Premise | Supports = The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out ] . [ Instead of using many private cars , people can use public transportation , such as bus , train , subway , each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person | Premise | Supports = The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out ] .

Target TANL: [ The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution | Claim ] . [ Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide , heat and so on | Premise | Supports = The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution ] . [ They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer | Premise | Supports = The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution ] . [ The more cars are driven , the more pollution will be put into air | Premise | Supports = The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution ] . [ If we use the public transportation , less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted | Premise | Supports = The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution ] . [ The atmosphere , surrounding us , will be protected and help us more healthy | Premise | Supports = The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution ] .

Target TANL: [ The use of public transportation make us live more sociable | Claim ] . [ When we drive a private car , we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society | Premise | Supports = The use of public transportation make us live more sociable ] . [ When using public transportation , we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life | Premise | Supports = The use of public transportation make us live more sociable ] .

Target TANL: [ Using public transportation has a lot of advantages for the modern society facing a lot of problems : the environmental population , the isolation in life , the depletion of natural resources | MajorClaim ] . So , the government have to invest more for it and encourage people to use .

Target TANL: Some students prefer to study alone Everyone has their method to success in life . At school or university , success depends on how we study . Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups . Yet , [ I prefer to study individually | MajorClaim ] because [ it helps me to concentrate more , and it helps me to build my personality | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons | Claim ] . For instance , [ I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone | Premise | Supports = Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons ] . [ I can prepare my schedules , guidelines , exercises and go over them all | Premise | Supports = Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons ] . Moreover , [ we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math , reading , and drawing | Premise | Supports = Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons ] . In my opinion , [ I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone | Premise | Supports = Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons ] .

Target TANL: Additionally , [ we are building our personalities when we study alone | Claim ] . For example , [ answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent | Premise | Supports = we are building our personalities when we study alone ] . Also , [ it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future | Premise | Supports = we are building our personalities when we study alone ] . Personally , [ when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time , it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful | Premise | Supports = we are building our personalities when we study alone ] .

Target TANL: To conclude , there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group . In fact , [ I agree with the idea of studying a lone | MajorClaim ] since [ it helps me to focus more and establish my personality | Claim ] . Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group .

Target TANL: Some important characteristics of a co - worker At work , you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment . However , the relationship you need to maintain with your co - worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you , and in most instances you have to rely on him or her . Therefore in my view , [ a good co - worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation , trustworthiness , and fellowship | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ The co - workers should be cooperative with one another | Premise | Supports = if the co - workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment ] . [ If they do not cooperate , there will be lots of disputes | Premise | Supports = if the co - workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment ] . [ I once had a co - worker who was too family conscious | Premise | Supports = he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not ] . Therefore [ he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not | Premise | Supports = if the co - workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment ] . [ Most of the time , I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person | Premise | Supports = if the co - workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment ] . However , [ one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor | Premise | Supports = if the co - workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment ] . [ When I requested my co - worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early , he turned down my request giving a silly excuse | Premise | Supports = if the co - workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment ] . [ From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility | Premise | Supports = if the co - workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment ] . Therefore , I believe [ if the co - workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ The co - workers need to trust each other | Claim ] . [ They should not act on suspicion | Premise | Supports = The co - workers need to trust each other ] . [ This is a very important aspect in the work environment | Premise | Supports = The co - workers need to trust each other ] . [ I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co - worker for carrying tales to me | Premise | Supports = The co - workers need to trust each other ] . [ To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co - worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him | Premise | Supports = The co - workers need to trust each other ] . However [ I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co - worker gave up talking ill against him with me | Premise | Supports = The co - workers need to trust each other ] . [ But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department | Premise | Supports = The co - workers need to trust each other ] .

Target TANL: Finally , [ the co - workers should believe in fellowship | Claim ] . [ This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships | Premise | Supports = the co - workers should believe in fellowship ] . After all , [ you spend most of your day at office | Premise | Supports = the co - workers should believe in fellowship ] . [ If you have a good company in office , it is certainly a blessing | Premise | Supports = the co - workers should believe in fellowship ] .

Target TANL: Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom During these digital age , the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society . Almost every school develops their online class systems . One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning . Although , [ online classes have many advantages | Claim ] , for me , [ I prefer traditional learning classes | MajorClaim ] for several reasons .

Target TANL: First , [ the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying | Claim ] . [ Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class | Premise | Supports = the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate ' s ideas ] . Consequently , [ the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate ' s ideas | Premise | Supports = the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying ] . [ Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends | Premise | Supports = the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ classroom learning provides other activities than studying | Claim ] . [ During student ' s free time , they have a number of activities that they can join , such as playing sports , going to lab , or going to library | Premise | Supports = classroom learning provides other activities than studying ] . [ These activities lead to more interact with their friends | Premise | Supports = classroom learning provides other activities than studying ] . [ Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities | Premise | Supports = classroom learning provides other activities than studying ] , furthermore , [ they have a chance to learn about their societies | Premise | Supports = classroom learning provides other activities than studying ] . While [ the online course keeps the children at their home only | Premise | Supports = classroom learning provides other activities than studying ] .

Target TANL: Lastly , [ in school , there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice | Claim ] . [ The professor provides good answers to you | Premise | Supports = in school , there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice ] . [ They do not mind helping you , and they never leave you alone when you got a problem | Premise | Supports = in school , there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice ] . In contrast , [ in distance learning , these aspects of the professor had reduced their important | Premise | Supports = in school , there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice ] . [ The professor has been assigned to teach only | Premise | Supports = in school , there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice ] . Moreover , [ there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question | Premise | Supports = in school , there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ traditional learning still has many benefits to the students | MajorClaim ] . But in the future , it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools .

Target TANL: Non academic subjects should be removed from syllabus Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success . While some people believe that [ non - academic subjects should be completely removed , I strongly disagree with that | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ from the health point of view , schools should not only deliver academic subjects | Premise | Supports = Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health , it will also decrease their learning capability ] . [ If physical education is removed from the syllabus , there will be considerable negative effects on students’ health | Premise | Supports = Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health , it will also decrease their learning capability ] . For instance , [ after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning , it is better for students to do some outdoor activities , such as stretching , jogging and playing ball games , in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes | Premise | Supports = Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health , it will also decrease their learning capability ] . [ Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health , it will also decrease their learning capability | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In addition , [ schools are responsible for developing their students into well - rounded people | Premise | Supports = school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student ] . [ It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically | Premise | Supports = school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student ] . [ Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student , which requires more than academic knowledge , but also practical life skills such as cooking , good communication skills and teamwork spirit | Premise | Supports = school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student ] . Thus , [ school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student | Claim ] as [ it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life | Premise | Supports = school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student ] .

Target TANL: Some people may argue that [ students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents | Claim ] . However , I believe that [ it is not a good idea | Premise | Attacks = students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents ] because [ most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents | Premise | Supports = it is not a good idea ] . Moreover , [ parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills | Premise | Attacks = students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I strongly believe that [ non - academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student’s development | Claim ] . Therefore , [ schools should not remove these subjects | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Follow the New Customs of the New Country or Not ? When people move to another country , most likely , they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one . Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture , while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted . As for me , [ I would follow the new customs , if I migrated to another country | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: On one hand , [ it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country , if they follow the new customs | Claim ] . [ When people migrate to a new country , they are likely to suffer the culture shock , because of the difference between two cultures | Premise | Supports = it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country , if they follow the new customs ] . [ The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture | Premise | Supports = it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country , if they follow the new customs ] . For example , [ if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer - than - usual , full - length Buddhist sutra in Buddha ' s Birthday in India , he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture | Premise | Supports = people understand the culture , and then they adapt to the new country ] . As a result , [ people understand the culture , and then they adapt to the new country | Premise | Supports = it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country , if they follow the new customs ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination | Claim ] . [ When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one , they regard themselves as a special group in the new country | Premise | Supports = keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination ] . [ The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main - stream society | Premise | Supports = keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination ] . [ One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969 | Premise | Supports = keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination ] . [ They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it | Premise | Supports = keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination ] . [ While the Indonesians stopped working at 4 : 00 pm and went home for rest , Chinese immigrants were still working | Premise | Supports = keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination ] . Although [ being much richer than local people , they faced the discrimination | Premise | Supports = keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination ] . [ Their houses and private cars were buried by local people | Premise | Supports = keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination ] , because [ the locals were jealous of Chinese people , who had so much wealth , which should have been theirs | Premise | Supports = Their houses and private cars were buried by local people ] . [ If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia , they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated | Premise | Supports = keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination ] .

Target TANL: All in all , [ the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country | MajorClaim ] , which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner , and assimilate to a new culture .

Target TANL: School memories Everyone has happy moments during their life . These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood . In my opinion , [ childhood is the happiest time of a person ' s life | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First , [ in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood | Claim ] . [ They do not have to worry about bills , jobs , how would their life be in the future | Premise | Supports = in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood ] . [ They just worry about two things : to have fun , learn and be happy | Premise | Supports = in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood ] . [ A child ' s daily life is school , playing and sleeping | Premise | Supports = They do not have to worry about bills , jobs , how would their life be in the future ] . For example , [ when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood | Premise | Supports = in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood ] . Moreover , [ I did not have to worry about costs and other things , I just had fun and learned | Premise | Supports = in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood ] . Also , [ people are most creative when they were children | Claim ] , [ children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy | Premise | Supports = people are most creative when they were children ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ childhood is the period where people go to school and learn | Premise | Supports = school memories are one of the best memories in a person ' s life ] . Therefore , [ school memories are one of the best memories in a person ' s life | Claim ] . [ There you learn , to find your first love , to make new long - lasting friendships and of - course you will have a lot of fun | Premise | Supports = school memories are one of the best memories in a person ' s life ] . For example , [ my father ' s best moments in his life are in his school years | Premise | Supports = There you learn , to find your first love , to make new long - lasting friendships and of - course you will have a lot of fun ] . Moreover , [ he is still in - touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories | Premise | Supports = There you learn , to find your first love , to make new long - lasting friendships and of - course you will have a lot of fun ] .

Target TANL: In other words , [ childhood is , indeed , the most happiest moments in a person ' s life | MajorClaim ] . There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly .

Target TANL: Learning to be independent is essential for young adults Learning to be independent is essential for young adults . However , how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue . In my point of view , [ staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult | MajorClaim ] . My opinion is based on creating memories with parents , saving money , and taking advice from parents .

Target TANL: First of all , one of the most significant upsides is that [ the young adult can have more experience with his parents | Premise | Supports = undergoing with parents is worthwhile ] . [ The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age | Premise | Supports = undergoing with parents is worthwhile ] . [ When having a job , it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown | Premise | Supports = undergoing with parents is worthwhile ] . [ If he lives with his parents for longer time , they have more chances to share the feelings , exercise , and travel together | Premise | Supports = undergoing with parents is worthwhile ] . [ All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by | Premise | Supports = undergoing with parents is worthwhile ] . Thus , I think [ undergoing with parents is worthwhile | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , [ living at home costs less than living outside | Premise | Supports = the parents can save money , if their children live with them longer ] . [ Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home | Premise | Supports = he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents ] . Therefore , [ he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents | Premise | Supports = the parents can save money , if their children live with them longer ] . Moreover , [ another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings | Premise | Supports = the parents can save money , if their children live with them longer ] . [ Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be | Premise | Supports = the parents can save money , if their children live with them longer ] . In a word , [ the parents can save money , if their children live with them longer | Claim ] .

Target TANL: The third convincing reason is that [ the young adult needs father and mother ' s suggestions | Premise | Supports = taking advice from parents , the young adult can go through obstacles easily ] . [ When in dilemma , the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand | Premise | Supports = taking advice from parents , the young adult can go through obstacles easily ] . [ They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way | Premise | Supports = taking advice from parents , the young adult can go through obstacles easily ] . [ If the parents do not help him immediately , he would have to suffer more pain | Premise | Supports = taking advice from parents , the young adult can go through obstacles easily ] . Hence , [ taking advice from parents , the young adult can go through obstacles easily | Claim ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , [ living with parents longer brings about memories with parents , less cost , and advice from parents | Claim ] . Hence , [ staying longer with parents is a better choice | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization , which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily . However , I do not agree with them . I believe that [ the zoo is invaluable for human beings | MajorClaim ] . [ It is very crucial for learning | Claim ] . [ It helps animals out of extinction | Claim ] . Also , [ it is a interesting travel location | Claim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ the zoo gives humans new knowledge | Claim ] . When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals , what should you do if there were no zoo ? Inevitably , [ the zoo is the important place for innate learning | Premise | Supports = the zoo gives humans new knowledge ] . [ The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically | Premise | Supports = the zoo gives humans new knowledge ] . [ They are able to observe animals ' behaviors and features | Premise | Supports = the zoo gives humans new knowledge ] . Moreover , [ practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class | Premise | Supports = the zoo gives humans new knowledge ] . Besides , [ researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches | Premise | Supports = the zoo gives humans new knowledge ] because [ it has diverse species of animals | Premise | Supports = researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats | Claim ] . [ In the zoo , there is not so harmful as a forest | Premise | Supports = the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats ] .

Furthermore , [ we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife | Premise | Supports = the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats ] .

Target TANL: Last but not least , [ because of all weird , acute , and beautiful animals in the zoo , it can be a great tourist attraction | Premise | Supports = It benefits to a certain country ] . [ There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely | Premise | Supports = It benefits to a certain country ] . [ If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists , it will receive a great deal of money | Premise | Supports = It benefits to a certain country ] . [ That also make money flow , and then economics become better | Premise | Supports = It benefits to a certain country ] . [ It benefits to a certain country | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction , but also helps people around the world have better lives | Claim ] . I firmly believe that [ the zoo is so useful for the earth | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Nowadays , spending budget on space exploration is not reasonable Space exploration , for discovery of out of space , has been possible for human in the 20th century . The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject . In my opinion , [ spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget | Premise | Attacks = it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets ] , while [ the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living | Premise | Attacks = Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget ] . [ In 20th century , although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets , but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now | Premise | Supports = it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets ] . [ In during history , our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity | Premise | Supports = it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets ] . Therefore , [ it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war | Premise | Supports = space exploration will use as a military power for many countries ] . [ In the future , many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles | Premise | Supports = space exploration will use as a military power for many countries ] . [ In the past , the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union | Premise | Supports = space exploration will use as a military power for many countries ] . [ Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other | Premise | Supports = space exploration will use as a military power for many countries ] . As a result , [ space exploration will use as a military power for many countries | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In summary , [ spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget | MajorClaim ] , because [ it may helps to save civilization of humanity | Claim ] . Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets , nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered .

Target TANL: Friendship is more important than mistake by a friend , although mistake is terrible There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship . It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result . However , I believe that [ friendship is more important than mistake by a friend | MajorClaim ] , although [ mistake is terrible | Claim ] . In this essay , I will present two reasons supporting my opinion .

Target TANL: First of all , [ a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever | Premise | Supports = mistake is more forgettable than friendship ] . [ Anybody does not remember mistakes | Premise | Supports = mistake is more forgettable than friendship ] . [ If someone remembers mistake , he or she has a closed mind | Premise | Supports = mistake is more forgettable than friendship ] . I want to say that [ mistakes will be forgotten quickly | Premise | Supports = mistake is more forgettable than friendship ] . For example , [ my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift | Premise | Supports = mistake is more forgettable than friendship ] . However , [ I forgot about it just after two days , and I felt at peace with him | Premise | Supports = mistake is more forgettable than friendship ] . Some people might say I am silly , but I think [ mistake is more forgettable than friendship | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ Everybody makes mistake | Claim ] . However , [ if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake , there will be no friends around you | Premise | Supports = Everybody makes mistake ] . I agree [ if a friend makes very a big mistake , we will need to end a friendship | Premise | Attacks = if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake , there will be no friends around you ] . However , [ when the mistake friend made was not a big problem , we need to understand friend and forgive it | Premise | Supports = Everybody makes mistake ] because [ a friend is a gift of our life | Premise | Supports = when the mistake friend made was not a big problem , we need to understand friend and forgive it ] . [ According to a research , 85 % of people answered that a best gift is a friend | Premise | Supports = Everybody makes mistake ] .

Target TANL: I think that [ a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big | MajorClaim ] because [ friendship is forever and gift our life | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Students should be required to take regular standardized tests The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams . This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it . However , I believe that [ standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ standardized tests are preferable | Claim ] due to the fact that [ they help teachers to fairly grade the students | Premise | Supports = standardized tests are preferable ] . For example [ some students are not so active on the lessons , cause they are already familiar with the issue | Premise | Supports = exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students ] . Therefore , [ exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students | Premise | Supports = standardized tests are preferable ] . In addition , [ many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class | Premise | Supports = the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them ] , so [ the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them | Premise | Supports = standardized tests are preferable ] .

Target TANL: Additionally , [ standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice | Premise | Supports = schools should require students to take standardized tests , as long as this option helps to both sides ] . Since , [ some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard | Premise | Supports = they will never try to solve problems on their own ] , so [ they will never try to solve problems on their own | Premise | Supports = standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice ] . However , [ standardized tests offer them such chance | Premise | Supports = schools should require students to take standardized tests , as long as this option helps to both sides ] . Thus , it is clear that [ schools should require students to take standardized tests , as long as this option helps to both sides | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Finally , I think that [ requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice | Claim ] , since [ in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students | Premise | Supports = requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice ] . [ In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance , so teachers could work with them more intensively | Premise | Supports = requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice ] . I support the points of those who say that [ standardized tests are required over those who don’t | Premise | Supports = requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice ] because [ if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them | Premise | Supports = standardized tests are required over those who don’t ] .

Target TANL: Ultimately I feel that [ schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right | MajorClaim ] . I belive this , due to the fact that [ these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Most difficult experiences will become valuable lessons There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success . For that reason , some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives . However , some people think it isn ' t supposed to be that case . From my point of view , I am in favor the former statement that [ some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: To start with , [ hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as , a shining weather , a delicious breakfast and etc | Premise | Supports = experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time ] . [ People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end | Premise | Supports = experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time ] . As a result , [ experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time | Claim ] .

Target TANL: What ' s more , [ people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles | Claim ] . Because [ they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties | Premise | Supports = they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens ] , [ they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens | Premise | Supports = people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles ] . [ Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career | Premise | Supports = people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles ] because [ they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way | Premise | Supports = Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career ] .

Target TANL: So , to sum it up , both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that [ most tough experiences in people ' s life path will be a priceless treasure to them | MajorClaim ] . Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties , then you will be in the troubles all the time .

Target TANL: Life in a city is much better than life in the countryside As far as I am concerned , I agree with the statement that [ life in a city is much better than life in the countryside | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ in the city there is much better education system | Claim ] . This means , that [ the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places | Premise | Supports = in the city there is much better education system ] .

Target TANL: In addition , I believe that [ city provides more work opportunities than the countryside | Claim ] . [ There are not only more jobs , but they are also well - paid | Premise | Supports = city provides more work opportunities than the countryside ] . Of course [ living in a city is more expensive | Premise | Attacks = city provides more work opportunities than the countryside ] , but [ incomes are higher | Premise | Attacks = living in a city is more expensive ] too .

Target TANL: Moreover , [ in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means , that the culture diversity is huge | Claim ] . [ Meeting and knowing new people ' s tradition is an unforgettable experience , which could influence on one ' s previous habits | Premise | Supports = in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means , that the culture diversity is huge ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , [ the city has well - organised lines of transport | Premise | Supports = the city provides better communication ] . [ The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside | Premise | Supports = the city provides better communication ] , so [ the city provides better communication | Claim ] .

Target TANL: However , [ in the countryside there are many places to rest , because of its location | Claim ] . Moreover , [ peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness | Premise | Supports = in the countryside there are many places to rest , because of its location ] .

Target TANL: Taking all into account , I think that [ living in the city is much better nowadays | MajorClaim ] , because of the opportunities it gives . Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle , which for me is without perspective . If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure .

Target TANL: E - mail or Voice mail Versus Telephone or face to face Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day . Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much . Voice mail , e - mail , telephone or just traditional way : face - to - face . However , [ I prefer e - mail due to 3 reasons : convenience , honest expression and fluency in communicating | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Everyone agrees that [ e - mail has been a great way of communication | Claim ] . [ You can talk to others from thousands mile | Premise | Supports = e - mail has been a great way of communication ] . For instance , [ if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth , no matter how far it is , you can keep contact | Premise | Supports = You can talk to others from thousands mile ] . [ We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address | Premise | Supports = e - mail has been a great way of communication ] . [ If the address is wrong , then you will know right away | Premise | Supports = We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address ] . Moreover , [ e - mail doesn ' t take too much time : just a click | Premise | Supports = e - mail has been a great way of communication ] .

Target TANL: In addition , [ writing e - mail helps people express honestly | Claim ] . Some people think that [ the face - to - face conversations make them feel stupid | Premise | Supports = writing e - mail helps people express honestly ] . [ Sometimes , their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect | Premise | Supports = the face - to - face conversations make them feel stupid ] . For instance , [ I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior , it ' s hard for me to face her and explain what she should do | Premise | Supports = e - mail will be a good tool to help me speak out ] . Therefore , [ e - mail will be a good tool to help me speak out | Premise | Supports = writing e - mail helps people express honestly ] . [ She will just read my e - mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed | Premise | Supports = e - mail will be a good tool to help me speak out ] . [ I don ' t have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive | Premise | Supports = e - mail will be a good tool to help me speak out ] .

Target TANL: Last but not least , [ every communication needs fluency | Premise | Supports = people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time ] so [ people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time | Premise | Supports = E - mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive ] . [ Voice email or face - to - face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident | Premise | Supports = E - mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive ] . For example , [ when I face my parents , I can ' t speak out every idea and express consecutively | Premise | Supports = Voice email or face - to - face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident ] . [ They may stop me , speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say | Premise | Supports = Voice email or face - to - face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident ] . [ Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation | Premise | Supports = Voice email or face - to - face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident ] . [ E - mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive | Claim ] .

Target TANL: On the whole , to compare to all ways of communication , I really think that [ e - mail is the greatest way for major people to use | MajorClaim ] . [ Its convenience saves our time | Claim ] . Additionally , honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can ' t be missing for a persuasive expression .

Target TANL: Communicating via e - mail and voice mail vs Telephone and face - to face Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face - to - face , personally I believe that [ communicating by e - mails or voice mails is better | MajorClaim ] . There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ communicating by e - mail is easy | Claim ] . [ Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with | Premise | Supports = communicating by e - mail is easy ] . [ In this case it is not so difficult to write an e - mail or to leave a voice mail | Premise | Supports = communicating by e - mail is easy ] because [ even shy people feel themselves more confident | Premise | Supports = In this case it is not so difficult to write an e - mail or to leave a voice mail ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ you can write an e - mail at any time of the day | Claim ] . As for me , [ I work and study at the university and I don ' t have spare time during the day | Premise | Supports = you can write an e - mail at any time of the day ] . [ I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems | Premise | Supports = you can write an e - mail at any time of the day ] . [ I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time | Premise | Supports = for me it is better to leave a voice mail ] so [ for me it is better to leave a voice mail | Premise | Supports = you can write an e - mail at any time of the day ] .

Target TANL: Thirdly , [ when you write an e - mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself | Claim ] . For example , [ you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite | Premise | Supports = when you write an e - mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself ] . [ When you speak face - to - face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e - mail | Premise | Supports = when you write an e - mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself ] .

Target TANL: And finally , [ there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e - mail | Claim ] . [ You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business | Premise | Supports = there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e - mail ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible , but if this is an important and not urgent question [ I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Should we require our young children to learn music and art Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful . In order to achieve this , they start cultivating their children when they are very young . In addition to basic knowledge like language or science , music and art are usually on the must - learn list of the parents . In my opinion , I agree that [ children should learn music and art in a young age | MajorClaim ] because [ they do contribute several merits to them | Claim ] .

Target TANL: First , [ it ' s very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young | Claim ] . [ Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art - imagination | Premise | Supports = it ' s very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young ] . [ Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules | Premise | Supports = it ' s very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young ] . [ They are more abstract , requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched | Premise | Supports = Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules ] . [ Children are privileged to have these abilities | Premise | Supports = it ' s very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young ] because [ they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances | Premise | Supports = Children are privileged to have these abilities ] . [ Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies , music and art still bring out children ' s joy of flying in imagination | Premise | Supports = it ' s very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ music and art are life - long cultivation worthy of investing | Premise | Supports = even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists , learning music and art is still worthy ] . [ They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way | Premise | Supports = even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists , learning music and art is still worthy ] . [ They are essential to our spiritual life | Premise | Supports = even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists , learning music and art is still worthy ] . Therefore , [ even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists , learning music and art is still worthy | Claim ] because [ it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure | Premise | Supports = even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists , learning music and art is still worthy ] .

Target TANL: However , some people might argue that [ parents shouldn ' t put so much stress on children | Claim ] , since [ learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them | Premise | Supports = parents shouldn ' t put so much stress on children ] . In my opinion , [ it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like | Premise | Attacks = parents shouldn ' t put so much stress on children ] . [ If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer , that might be too much | Premise | Supports = it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like ] . [ In a child stage , music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills | Premise | Supports = it will not be such pressure on children ] . In this way , [ it will not be such pressure on children | Premise | Attacks = parents shouldn ' t put so much stress on children ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art | MajorClaim ] and [ they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage , but in every stage | Claim ] . [ Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his / her life | Claim ] .

Target TANL: The car use will definitely decrease in twenty years Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not . Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen , the car use will decrease . While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life . Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason . But as far as I am concerned , I agree with the idea , which is that [ there will be a decrease in cars use in the future | MajorClaim ] . The following reasons will present my points .

Target TANL: First of all , since [ the public transportation has improved | Premise | Supports = it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus ] , [ it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus | Claim ] . For example , [ I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn ' t have enough parking lots for the cars | Premise | Supports = with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own ] . So , [ with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own | Premise | Supports = it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world | Premise | Supports = with the risen of the aware to the environment , people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not ] . So , [ with the risen of the aware to the environment , people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not | Claim ] . For example , [ instead of driving each one ' s car , if we put forty people in a bus , it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city | Premise | Supports = with the risen of the aware to the environment , people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not ] .

Target TANL: Although , I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years . I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view . People who hold different opinion may argue that [ a personal car uses is in need | Claim ] because [ a public transportation can ' t meet every place | Premise | Supports = a personal car uses is in need ] . Of course , [ it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places | Premise | Supports = a personal car uses is in need ] . However , [ no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on , it always have some other ways that you can do , you can ride a bike , or even walk on your feet | Premise | Supports = a personal car uses is in need ] . [ It not only helps you to reduce the car use , but also good to your health | Premise | Supports = no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on , it always have some other ways that you can do , you can ride a bike , or even walk on your feet ] . In this way , [ this won ' t be a problem at all | Premise | Attacks = a public transportation can ' t meet every place ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , given the reasons described above , when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared , the best choice is obviously stand on my side , which is that [ the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Working at home vs Working in a company Due to the convenience of current technology , people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them . People are no longer restricted in the office . This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it ' s better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company ' s office . In my opinion , I believe that [ working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ while working in the office , people can interact with their colleges instantly | Claim ] . [ They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together | Premise | Supports = while working in the office , people can interact with their colleges instantly ] . [ Think about the big project that a group is working on , if any group member has new idea about the project , he / she can assemble his / her colleges right away and discuss | Premise | Supports = while working in the office , people can interact with their colleges instantly ] . [ It ' s more efficient and straight - forward than talking in the phone | Premise | Supports = while working in the office , people can interact with their colleges instantly ] . For another example , [ if one’s computer or Internet has any breakdown , he / she can call the MIS staff to fix | Premise | Supports = while working in the office , people can interact with their colleges instantly ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works | Claim ] . For example , [ people are easily distracted while working at home | Premise | Supports = working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works ] . [ It ' s hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away | Premise | Supports = people are easily distracted while working at home ] . In addition , [ while people are working at home , there will be no one supervising them , thus raises the chance of loafing | Premise | Supports = working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works ] . Moreover , [ people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office , like some announcements from the boss | Premise | Supports = working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency | MajorClaim ] . [ It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home | Claim ] .

Target TANL: The ability to relate well to people is more important I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations . We should consider many factors and choose the best of them . I believe that [ both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job | MajorClaim ] for following reasons :

Target TANL: [ We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job | Premise | Supports = studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job ] . [ This can be done in school | Premise | Supports = studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job ] . [ In school , we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them | Premise | Supports = studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job ] . [ If we study them hard , we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future | Premise | Supports = studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job ] . For example , [ if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer , he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job | Premise | Supports = studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job ] . As you can see , [ studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation | Premise | Supports = relating well to people is also another important factor ] . [ By relating well to people , we are likely to have a lot of friends | Premise | Supports = we will have a wide network of communication ] and therefore [ we will have a wide network of communication | Premise | Supports = relating well to people is also another important factor ] . [ Commuincation can bring many benefits | Premise | Supports = relating well to people is also another important factor ] . For example , [ if you need help with getting a job , by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well | Premise | Supports = they respect you as well , you can achieve your goal ] and therefore [ they respect you as well , you can achieve your goal | Premise | Supports = relating well to people is also another important factor ] . Or , [ if you are a salesman in a store or any other place , by relating well to your customers , you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers | Premise | Supports = relating well to people is also another important factor ] . So , [ relating well to people is also another important factor | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In sum , though some people may disagree with me , as I explained my reasons and examples above , none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and [ we should notice to both of them | MajorClaim ] because [ each of them has its own benefits | Claim ] .

Target TANL: The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits Advertising is becoming part of our modern society . They penetrate into people ' s life , affecting people ' s choices in different things . Therefore , it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people ' s life . Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits , while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people ' s judgments . In my opinion , [ the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: First of all , [ advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit | Claim ] . [ The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people ' s concept of wholesome diets and self - control | Premise | Supports = advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit ] . It is sure that [ advertising always makes the products so tempting , regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body | Premise | Attacks = advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit ] . However , [ advertising is not the only information source for people | Premise | Supports = advertising always makes the products so tempting , regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body ] . [ People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources , like news or magazines | Premise | Supports = advertising is not the only information source for people ] . [ As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits , they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations | Premise | Supports = advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit ] . [ It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast - food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors | Premise | Supports = advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle , some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods | Premise | Supports = advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people ] . In other words , [ advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people | Claim ] . [ Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added | Premise | Supports = advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people ] . [ These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good | Premise | Supports = advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people ] . In these cases , [ the advertising industry bolsters people ' s awareness of having a healthy lifestyle | Premise | Supports = advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits | MajorClaim ] . [ There are the build - up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self - control that really matter | Claim ] . Besides , [ advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle | Claim ] . It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away . We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles .

Target TANL: Learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students ' future lives There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not . Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students , I am in the conviction that [ learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students ' future lives | MajorClaim ] . In the following , I will state my reasons for this choice .

Target TANL: First , [ when students learn facts more in school , they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations | Premise | Supports = they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better ] . As a case in point , [ more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts | Premise | Supports = they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better ] . As a result , [ they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ it would improve students ' social behavior | Claim ] . [ If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically , they would not realize human ' s mind very well | Premise | Supports = it would improve students ' social behavior ] . [ They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well | Premise | Supports = if they deal more with facts , they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life ] . Thus , [ if they deal more with facts , they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life | Premise | Supports = it would improve students ' social behavior ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , [ these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts | Premise | Supports = when a student understands a fact and its consequences , he or she can encounter it more confidently ] . As a matter of fact , [ when a student understands a fact and its consequences , he or she can encounter it more confidently | Claim ] . In my viewpoint , [ concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody ' s life | Premise | Supports = when a student understands a fact and its consequences , he or she can encounter it more confidently ] . [ It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position | Premise | Supports = when a student understands a fact and its consequences , he or she can encounter it more confidently ] .

Target TANL: All in all , I am in the belief that [ learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life | MajorClaim ] in the view of above - mentioned reasons . [ Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Financial support for sports and social activities There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes . It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities . Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges , I think that [ these activities have the same efficient role in students ' lives | MajorClaim ] . In the following , I will state my reason for this choice .

Target TANL: First , [ besides the good body shape , sports have very vital effects on human ' s healthfulness | Premise | Supports = sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health ] . In my viewpoint , [ our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly | Premise | Supports = sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health ] . As a case in point , [ last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back | Premise | Supports = I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well ] . [ After that exam , I felt depressed and exhausted | Premise | Supports = I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well ] .

Thus [ social activities can help them to be familiar with other ' s mind and different environment | Premise | Supports = social activities have same rights to receive monetary support ] . In my opinion , [ social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment | Premise | Supports = social activities have same rights to receive monetary support ] . So , [ social activities have same rights to receive monetary support | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , [ they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments | Claim ] . [ If we follow just one wing of my life i . e . , studying as a student , after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn ' t have any motivation | Premise | Supports = they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments ] . [ Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends | Premise | Supports = they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments ] . In my perspective , [ more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me | Premise | Supports = they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments ] .

Target TANL: All in all , I am in the conviction that [ sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money | MajorClaim ] in the view of above - mentioned reasons . [ They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Learning a foreign language in my own country or another country Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time . Many people pursue to study foreign language . There are two options to learn foreign language . First is stay in homeland to study foreign language . The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken . [ Going to another place to learn language is better choice | MajorClaim ] . I will give reasons to support my opinion .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language | Claim ] . For example , [ everyone around me speaks foreign language , and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people | Premise | Supports = going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language ] . [ If I could not communicate with other people , I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger | Premise | Supports = going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language ] . [ This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language | Premise | Supports = going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster | Claim ] . For instance , [ English school in outside my home country , there are many people that come from different places and from different languages | Premise | Supports = having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster ] . [ The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language | Premise | Supports = having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster ] . Thus , [ I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong | Premise | Supports = having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster ] . [ This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster | Premise | Supports = having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster ] .

Target TANL: Getting opinions from many sources could augment people ' s performance . Getting opinions from many sources could augment people ' s performance . Thereby , evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system . Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students . Therefore , I agree with this notion that [ students should be asked to evaluate their teachers | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers ' performance | Premise | Supports = evaluating from students could improve teachers ' performance ] . For example , [ evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product | Premise | Supports = evaluating from students could improve teachers ' performance ] . [ Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information | Premise | Supports = teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give ] . Consequently , [ teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give | Premise | Supports = evaluating from students could improve teachers ' performance ] . Therefore , [ evaluating from students could improve teachers ' performance | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Additionally , [ this evaluation from students could improve schools ' quality | Claim ] . [ Teachers could augment their quality | Premise | Supports = this evaluation from students could improve schools ' quality ] . Consequently , [ When school gather teachers that have great performance , school are gaining higher quality | Premise | Supports = this evaluation from students could improve schools ' quality ] . For instance , [ in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products | Premise | Supports = this evaluation from students could improve schools ' quality ] because [ they have employees whose performance are very high | Premise | Supports = in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products ] . [ Schools could produce intellectual students | Premise | Supports = this evaluation from students could improve schools ' quality ] because [ school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students | Premise | Supports = Schools could produce intellectual students ] .

Target TANL: Finally , [ people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students | Claim ] . [ Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance | Premise | Supports = people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students ] . Because [ teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects | Premise | Supports = students could comprehend their subject easily ] , [ students could comprehend their subject easily | Premise | Supports = people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students ] . As a result , [ students , who study from great schools which have great performance teacher , graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life | Premise | Supports = people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I agree with this statement that [ school should ask students to evaluate their teachers | MajorClaim ] because [ teachers could improve their performance | Claim ] . Moreover , [ schools are also improve their quality | Claim ] because [ they have high performance teachers | Premise | Supports = schools are also improve their quality ] . Furthermore , [ students are easy to understand their subjects | Premise | Supports = schools are also improve their quality ] . Thus , I believe that [ there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Keep trying and never stop working for your goals " Keep running ! , " shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move . During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014 , I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute . At some moment , my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary . I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty . From this experience , I believe that [ a person should keep trying for his goals | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ committing to our goal helps creating personal worth | Claim ] . For example , [ I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard | Premise | Supports = committing to our goal helps creating personal worth ] . [ Even if I were not to win this medal , I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running | Premise | Supports = committing to our goal helps creating personal worth ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger | Claim ] . [ I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line | Premise | Supports = one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger ] . However , [ I did not give up , and believed that I would be better in the next round | Premise | Supports = one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger ] because [ I knew how to improve myself | Premise | Supports = I did not give up , and believed that I would be better in the next round ] . [ I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning , and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger | Premise | Supports = one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger ] .

Target TANL: Thirdly , at some point , [ we , as an average people , might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on | Premise | Attacks = the responsibility is worthy of carrying ] . I believe that [ the responsibility is worthy of carrying | Claim ] . [ When the distance is longer and harder to achieve , a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself | Premise | Supports = the responsibility is worthy of carrying ] . [ He can feel the sweetness of triumph | Premise | Supports = the responsibility is worthy of carrying ] because [ he did not stop pursing his goal | Premise | Supports = He can feel the sweetness of triumph ] .

Target TANL: For these reasons , I agree that [ one should not give up | MajorClaim ] , as [ the true reward is to have the dignity | Claim ] . [ Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength , and ultimately , it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Technology makes people ' s lives simpler rather than complicated Believe it or not , nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not , thus making them confused . Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier . Although I conceded [ technology may make people ' s life complicated in some aspects | Claim ] , [ the convenience it brings is more | MajorClaim ] . In what follows , I will illustrate my point of view .

Target TANL: First , [ when it comes to the field of transportation , there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people ' s life simpler | Claim ] . [ With a private car , you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle | Premise | Supports = when it comes to the field of transportation , there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people ' s life simpler ] . Alternatively , [ if you would like to have a trip across the ocean , a plane can carry you there in only a few hours , which is hard to imagine in the ancient times | Premise | Supports = when it comes to the field of transportation , there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people ' s life simpler ] .

Target TANL: Second , [ technology also makes teaching simpler | Claim ] . [ In the past , teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard , resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers | Premise | Supports = technology also makes teaching simpler ] . [ With the advent of iPads in e - learning , paper books become unnecessary , so does the blackboards | Premise | Supports = technology also makes teaching simpler ] , it is because [ all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads , with a single click , and they would appear right before your eyes at once | Premise | Supports = With the advent of iPads in e - learning , paper books become unnecessary , so does the blackboards ] .

Target TANL: Admittedly , to some extent , [ technology may make people ' s life more complicated | Claim ] . For example , [ the cell phone , which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance , now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications | Premise | Supports = technology may make people ' s life more complicated ] . For instance , [ folks have to check their Facebooks , Twitters , and Forums accounts every minute , which add too much pressure to them | Premise | Supports = technology may make people ' s life more complicated ] . In addition , [ games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers , leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones | Premise | Supports = technology may make people ' s life more complicated ] . Consequently , [ making their life more complicated and tired | Premise | Supports = technology may make people ' s life more complicated ] .

Target TANL: Based on the factors I have mentioned above , a conclusion can be drawn that although [ technology may make people ' s life complicated in some cases | Claim ] , [ the convenience it brings in people ' s are significant | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: More important to work quickly and risk making mistakes Organizations , these days , seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully . These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company . [ Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal | MajorClaim ] mentioned before . I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons . [ Trying to learn skills , working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice | Claim ] .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ if persons work rapidly , they will have more chance to study | Claim ] . [ Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter | Premise | Supports = if persons work rapidly , they will have more chance to study ] . [ If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying , they can stares in their workplace | Premise | Supports = if persons work rapidly , they will have more chance to study ] . For example , [ I have a friend who was working so slowly | Premise | Supports = If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying , they can stares in their workplace ] . [ He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him | Premise | Supports = If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying , they can stares in their workplace ] . [ My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working | Premise | Supports = If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying , they can stares in their workplace ] .

Target TANL: Most importantly , [ people prone to work in two or three firms in a week | Claim ] because [ the expenses have been increased | Premise | Supports = people prone to work in two or three firms in a week ] . [ If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money | Premise | Supports = people prone to work in two or three firms in a week ] . [ This fact pushes them to work faster and faster | Premise | Supports = people prone to work in two or three firms in a week ] . For example , because [ applying to study abroad needs a lot of money | Premise | Supports = I am working in two organization to gain more salary ] , [ I am working in two organization to gain more salary | Premise | Supports = people prone to work in two or three firms in a week ] . [ The more money , the more chances | Premise | Supports = people prone to work in two or three firms in a week ] .

Target TANL: Last but not least , [ people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks | Claim ] . [ If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly , your boss will assign you more tasks | Premise | Supports = people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks ] . [ If you do them fast too , the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder | Premise | Supports = people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks ] . [ It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation | Premise | Supports = people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks ] . [ Even if we ignore this result , by the same token , you can get higher position and more money | Premise | Supports = people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks ] .

Target TANL: To sum up , I completely approve of the statement which says [ people should work faster even more risky | MajorClaim ] . [ Gaining more skills by study , having more than one job , and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages | Claim ] . I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice .

Target TANL: New building construction hold the right to gain more money from government The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays . And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years . The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important . [ What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ Building more accommodating constructions meets people ' s basic need | Claim ] . [ People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in | Premise | Supports = Building more accommodating constructions meets people ' s basic need ] . [ If the price of housing grows continuously , a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class | Premise | Supports = Building more accommodating constructions meets people ' s basic need ] . Then , [ ordinary people , especially the younger generation , will fall into a certain pattern - work , pay bills for housing , work ; and I am sure that it will increase people ' s dissatisfaction of the government | Premise | Supports = Building more accommodating constructions meets people ' s basic need ] . Because [ when they are working , the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers , which will limit their efficiency | Premise | Supports = Building more accommodating constructions meets people ' s basic need ] . And [ government should spend money on people to rescue them from this | Premise | Supports = Building more accommodating constructions meets people ' s basic need ] , because [ only a government of the people , by the people , for the people will finally last ; people ' s cohesiveness will be promoted | Premise | Supports = government should spend money on people to rescue them from this ] .

Target TANL: Otherwise , another vital reason why [ new building construction deserves more governmental investment | Claim ] lies in the fact that [ it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation | Premise | Supports = new building construction deserves more governmental investment ] . [ Build a new building has following prerequisites , land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures , a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor | Premise | Supports = new building construction deserves more governmental investment ] . Except these , [ hundreds of problems would occur during the construction | Premise | Supports = new building construction deserves more governmental investment ] . Thus , [ only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness | Premise | Supports = new building construction deserves more governmental investment ] .

Target TANL: Generally , personally speaking , I believe [ new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Replacing old buildings is important for any city but it should not affect historic houses [ It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones , but these revolutions should not include historic buildings | MajorClaim ] .

[ By investigating about their structures , we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building | Premise | Supports = Historic buildings answer many questions , which are mysterious about our previous ancestors ; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings ] . In the other hand , [ historic buildings are important treasures , which provide an area to learn valuable lessons | Premise | Supports = Historic buildings answer many questions , which are mysterious about our previous ancestors ; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings ] .

Target TANL: [ Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city | Claim ] .

Therefore , [ It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors | Premise | Supports = Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city ] . [ Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on | Premise | Supports = Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city ] .

Moreover , [ they are the symbols of our nations , which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school . Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education , others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender . In my opinion , [ boys and girls should study together | MajorClaim ] in the sense that [ they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ School is a small society for students , which prepares them for the future life | Premise | Supports = By attending to the same school , students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate ] . [ By attending to the same school , students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate | Claim ] .

Admittedly , [ when they study together and help each other , they exercise the the real life as they age | Premise | Supports = By attending to the same school , students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate ] . By contrast , some experts believe that [ attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them | Premise | Attacks = By attending to the same school , students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate ] . By doing this , [ outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship | Premise | Supports = their thoughts deviate from the studies ] and as result , [ their thoughts deviate from the studies | Premise | Supports = attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them ] .

Target TANL: Moreover , [ attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better | Claim ] . [ Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class | Premise | Supports = they will study increasingly ] , therefore [ they will study increasingly | Premise | Supports = the productivity of the class will be increased ] . Indeed , [ Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa | Premise | Supports = they will study increasingly ] . As a result , [ the productivity of the class will be increased | Premise | Supports = attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better ] .

In addition , [ they would be able to know the opposite gender , which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together | Claim ] .

Target TANL: The city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity The city where I was born used to be of a great antique beauty , which was surrounded with by lots of ancient style buildings . Unfortunately , the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums . In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings , some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings . As far as I am concerned , [ we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings , letting next generations still have a chance to look at them | MajorClaim ] . Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint .

[ Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life ' s little annoyance and feel peaceful | Premise | Supports = historic buildings make our lives more colorful , provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds ] .

Target TANL: Do you agree that the traditional skills will die out ? With the development of technology , whether or not it is still necessary to protect the traditional skills and lifestyles leads to a drastic controversy which is becoming a public concern , especially considering the significant impact taken by technology . As far as I am concerned , [ the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: [ Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society , in terms of healthcare , environmental protection and cultural inherit | Claim ] . Although [ technology takes convenience to humankind | Premise | Attacks = Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society , in terms of healthcare , environmental protection and cultural inherit ] , [ it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life , like sedentary lifestyle | Premise | Attacks = technology takes convenience to humankind ] .

For example , [ a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability | Premise | Supports = every one can work and live in a peaceful environment ] , so that [ every one can work and live in a peaceful environment | Premise | Supports = all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government ] . [ The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors , such as teachers and police officers | Premise | Supports = all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government ] . Although [ these workers do not produce profit directly | Premise | Attacks = The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors , such as teachers and police officers ] , [ what they do is for the well - being of the whole society | Premise | Attacks = these workers do not produce profit directly ] .

Target TANL: However , I would argue that [ citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax | Claim ] . As we know , [ there are impoverished or disabled people in every society , needing help and support from others | Premise | Supports = citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax ] . It is true that [ the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties | Premise | Attacks = there are impoverished or disabled people in every society , needing help and support from others ] , but [ such financial help is usually far from enough | Premise | Attacks = the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties ] . In such case , [ aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial , which are a great complement to government support | Premise | Supports = citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax ] . [ Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force | Premise | Supports = citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax ] . [ There are criminals in every society , and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited | Premise | Supports = it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities , by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department ] . So [ it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities , by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department | Premise | Supports = citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government . Other than that , [ they have other critical obligations to take , in order to make our society function in an ordered way | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects In today ' s world , computer is an essential part of everyday life . Around the globe , the effect is evident on children also . [ It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis | MajorClaim ] . This will be proven by analyzing how [ computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers | Claim ] .

Target TANL: [ The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text , image or video related to almost everything | Premise | Supports = through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about ] and [ through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about | Premise | Supports = computer impacts children on a positive note ] . As an example , [ students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter | Premise | Supports = computer impacts children on a positive note ] . [ It ' s hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers | Premise | Supports = computer impacts children on a positive note ] . That is how , [ computer impacts children on a positive note | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Nowadays , [ computers enable people to prepare presentations , draw complex graphs and pictures , document thesis in a simple though efficient way | Premise | Supports = it ' s clear that computer has a positive effect on the children ] . [ When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age , they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world | Premise | Supports = it ' s clear that computer has a positive effect on the children ] . For instance , [ students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects , get an edge over others at an early stage of their career | Premise | Supports = it ' s clear that computer has a positive effect on the children ] . From this , [ it ' s clear that computer has a positive effect on the children | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Following the demonstration of a computer ' s contribution in children ' s study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards , it is agreed that [ computer is a boon to children | MajorClaim ] . However , parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don ' t get misled .

Target TANL: Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children . Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre - school . However , those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years . This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children ' s learning . I personally believe that [ it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years | Claim ] . [ Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to | Premise | Supports = children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years ] . Moreover , [ teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning | Premise | Supports = children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years ] . Another important thing to consider is that [ the teacher should be well - trained in the use of this specific language , so quality education will be delivered | Premise | Supports = children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years ] .

Target TANL: Nevertheless , it is undeniable that [ kids are amazing learners , and the best time to hone them is in their younger years | Premise | Supports = the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages ] . [ The introduction of foreign language will be new to them | Premise | Attacks = the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages ] ; however , [ their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend | Premise | Attacks = The introduction of foreign language will be new to them ] . In this way , [ grasping a new language will be natural to them | Premise | Attacks = The introduction of foreign language will be new to them ] . In addition , [ the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers | Premise | Supports = the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages ] . [ Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years | Premise | Supports = the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages ] . It is certainly clear that [ the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages | Claim ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people ; however , there are those who disagree . I am totally convinced that [ if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools , this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: International tourism leads to both - tension and understanding I agree with both opinions that [ international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture | MajorClaim ] , because [ most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates | Claim ] .

Target TANL: There is no doubt that [ some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area | Claim ] . Firstly , [ some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions | Premise | Supports = those local residents have to clean the place frequently ] . Therefore , [ those local residents have to clean the place frequently | Premise | Supports = the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment ] so that [ the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment | Premise | Supports = some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area ] . Moreover , [ tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background | Premise | Supports = some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area ] . For example , [ Indians don ' t eat beef | Premise | Supports = tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background ] since [ they worship cows | Premise | Supports = Indians don ' t eat beef ] . Thus , [ if tourists want to respect the tradition , they will not order any beef in the local restaurant | Premise | Supports = tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals , people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions | Claim ] . For instance , [ tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place | Premise | Supports = in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals , people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions ] . Furthermore , [ the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries | Premise | Supports = the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties ] . Thus , [ the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties | Premise | Supports = in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals , people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions ] .

Target TANL: Obviously , [ people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism | Claim ] . Hence , I think [ international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever These days , most of countries on the world invest for technology . It is evident that technology promotes economy . Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated . I totally disagree this opinion .

Target TANL: First of all , [ traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture | Claim ] . [ They make differences between countries | Premise | Supports = traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture ] . [ Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation , intelligence | Premise | Supports = people feel pround of their country ] . Consequently , [ people feel pround of their country | Premise | Supports = they keep reserving conventions ] , so [ they keep reserving conventions | Premise | Supports = traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture ] . For example , [ ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries | Premise | Supports = traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture ] .

Target TANL: In addition , [ in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology | Claim ] . [ Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability | Premise | Supports = in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology ] . In paticular , [ vases are made by hand would be used more | Premise | Supports = Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability ] . Futhermore , [ there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method | Premise | Supports = in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology ] . For instance , [ making cone hats from leaves have to use hand | Premise | Supports = there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method ] . [ Not only because there is no machine for the work , but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand , so resulting in greater value economy | Premise | Supports = making cone hats from leaves have to use hand ] .

Target TANL: The last thing is about education . [ Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history | Claim ] . [ Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations | Premise | Supports = Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history ] . After that , [ they might create somethings that are useful for life | Premise | Supports = Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ technology has brought many benefits | Claim ] , but [ traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Capital punishment ; 51 % countries have polished death penalty " Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime . " In recently years , many countries have polished the law of the death penalty . In the whole world , 51 % countries have polished death penalty ; even , it is at 98 % in Europe . Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase . However , others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty . Personally , I think [ it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty | MajorClaim ] because of many reasons .

Target TANL: Firstly , [ capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture | Premise | Supports = death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture ] . [ Crimes kill someone which is illegal ; nevertheless , the government use law to punish them , which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one | Premise | Supports = death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture ] . As a fact that [ the criminal is repeated second time | Premise | Supports = it is regarded as the " legalized revenge " to victims ' family ] ; also , [ it is regarded as the " legalized revenge " to victims ' family | Premise | Supports = death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture ] . Hence , [ death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Secondly , [ nobody has the right to take another human life | Claim ] . It is undeniable that [ the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being | Premise | Supports = nobody has the right to take another human life ] . [ No one has the right to take the life of a human ; even if he committed murder | Premise | Supports = the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being ] . [ If you kill a criminal , you become a criminal | Premise | Supports = nobody has the right to take another human life ] . Moreover , [ if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem , it is neither unethical nor immoral | Premise | Supports = nobody has the right to take another human life ] . In short , [ crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment | Premise | Supports = nobody has the right to take another human life ] .

Target TANL: Finally , [ with some of serious criminals , capital punishment is an easy way out | Claim ] . [ Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds | Premise | Supports = with some of serious criminals , capital punishment is an easy way out ] . [ If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins , it is so easy for them | Premise | Supports = with some of serious criminals , capital punishment is an easy way out ] . [ They do not undergo any pain or misery | Premise | Supports = with some of serious criminals , capital punishment is an easy way out ] . Why do not we have other wisely punishments ? As we can see [ some industries such as mining , oil and gas extraction , reclamation , etc , needs many labors | Premise | Supports = with some of serious criminals , capital punishment is an easy way out ] . [ Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country - it is better | Premise | Supports = with some of serious criminals , capital punishment is an easy way out ] . Moreover , [ rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts | Premise | Supports = with some of serious criminals , capital punishment is an easy way out ] .

Target TANL: To conclude , [ capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge , it is an easy way for serious crimes , and nobody has rights to take others life | Premise | Supports = it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society ] ; thus , [ it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society | Claim ] . [ The world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: Technology helps student learn more information and learn more quickly ? Nowadays , technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life . In education , it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances . From my viewpoint , [ the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students ' progress | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: To start with , since [ technology was introduced , student have been exposed to a wide range of information , which neccessarily broaden their minds | Claim ] . [ The internet , for example , provide knowledge in the form of news , radio talks , tapes or reseachs on any particular fields | Premise | Supports = technology was introduced , student have been exposed to a wide range of information , which neccessarily broaden their minds ] . [ There , the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide | Premise | Supports = technology was introduced , student have been exposed to a wide range of information , which neccessarily broaden their minds ] .

Target TANL: [ Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning | Claim ] . [ The modern world provides learners with the mp3 , the mobile phone or the laptop that help them , especially language learners , listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime | Premise | Supports = students will develop their skills at a greater pace ] . Therefore , [ students will develop their skills at a greater pace | Premise | Supports = Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning ] . Moreover , [ the internet again , is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids , such as educational games , sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly | Premise | Supports = Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning ] .

Target TANL: On balance , [ I have to consent to the use of technology in education | MajorClaim ] , as [ it expedites data availability and accelarates students ' learning process | Claim ] . It is highly recommended that apart from education , technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future .

Target TANL: Classmates ' impacts on children ' s performance at school It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted . Their success should be attributed to many different external factors . It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments . However , in my opinion , [ the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: To begin with , [ the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children | Claim ] . [ In high school , for instance , an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same | Premise | Supports = the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children ] . [ From a psychological perspective , the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children , which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children ' s academic performances | Premise | Supports = the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children ] .

Target TANL: To add up , [ when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such , classmates are second to none | Claim ] . It is a matter of fact that [ students share even more time together than with their parents , explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others | Premise | Supports = when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such , classmates are second to none ] ; [ it can be , for example , lessons on the class , social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents | Premise | Supports = when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such , classmates are second to none ] . [ Sharing the same age , children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas , to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments , resulting in deeper comprehension | Premise | Supports = when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such , classmates are second to none ] .

Target TANL: All advantages considered , [ classmates are unrivalled by the children ' s parents | MajorClaim ] as [ they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion , two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society Nowadays , the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes . Personally , I believe [ such details should be strictly censored , if not banned altogether | MajorClaim ] .

Target TANL: It is widely known that [ the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating | Premise | Supports = a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased , exaggerated or fraudulent , which only result to terrorize communities and leave law - aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes ] . [ These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is , more often than that , to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings | Premise | Supports = a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased , exaggerated or fraudulent , which only result to terrorize communities and leave law - aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes ] . Consequently , [ a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased , exaggerated or fraudulent , which only result to terrorize communities and leave law - aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes | Claim ] .

Target TANL: An even more detrimental fact is that [ detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials , which would be hard to obtain otherwise | Premise | Supports = without the prevention on criminal details , the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken ] . [ This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans , avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police | Premise | Supports = without the prevention on criminal details , the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken ] . Thus , [ without the prevention on criminal details , the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken | Claim ] .

Target TANL: Most importantly , [ particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes | Claim ] because [ they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced | Premise | Supports = particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes ] . [ Without their consent , this could only add to theses innocent people ' s mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions | Premise | Supports = particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , I strongly hold my point that [ any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer | MajorClaim ] , [ as they may be false , may further drive up the already - high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes | Claim ] .

Target TANL: We can not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty . Personally , I do not agree the viewpoint , because [ many different characters exist between male and female students | Claim ] .

Target TANL: On one hand , [ boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality | Claim ] . [ Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act , and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases | Premise | Supports = boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality ] . For instance , [ there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world | Premise | Supports = boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality ] . [ Many boys are interested in science and technology , while a number of girls like to learn literature , education and arts | Premise | Supports = boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality ] . Besides , [ girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication , such as teacher , singer and interpreter | Premise | Supports = boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality ] . This means that [ girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent , and they both have better ability in the specific aspect | Premise | Supports = boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality ] .

Target TANL: Furthermore , [ it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender | Claim ] , and [ that does not conform to students ' personality traits and mental development | Premise | Supports = it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender ] . For example , [ a girl , who is interested in literature , is arranged into an engineering department | Premise | Supports = it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender ] , but [ she is unlikely to focus on her subject | Premise | Supports = it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender ] , and [ this also can block the girl ' s future development and career prospect | Premise | Supports = it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender ] .

Target TANL: On the other hand , [ universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities | Claim ] , and [ this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects | Premise | Supports = universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities ] . [ It would affect students ' mental health to study in the environment of single gender | Premise | Supports = universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities ] .

Target TANL: In conclusion , [ it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls , and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject | MajorClaim ] .
